      adapt_ena If 'Enabled', normal 'Adaptive Learn' mode is entered when the 
      proper conditions exist. If 'Disabled', 'Adaptive Learn' mode will never 
      be switched on under any circumstances (although 'Closed Loop' mode 
      functions normally). This feature is typically used for stationary engine 
      applications. 
      adapt_fuel_rpm_dz Adaptive learn table updates will be disabled when a 
      discrete governor is active, Adapt RPM Source is set to "Desired RPM", and 
      the difference between the actual RPM and the desired RPM is greater than 
      this threshold. 
      adapt_fuel_rpm_src This variable determines the fuel adaptive learn table 
      lookup RPM source.

      If "Actual RPM" is selected or a discrete governor is not active, then the 
      current RPM of the engine is used for the fuel adaptive table lookup.

      If "Desired RPM" is selected and the discrete governor is active, then the 
      desired RPM value is used to perform the fuel adaptive table lookups. 
      Adapt_neg_lim Gasoline: Adaptive Learn BM minimum (negative) allowed 
      Adapt_pos_lim Gasoline: Adaptive Learn BM maximum (positive) allowed 
      Adapt_start_wait Time from start until adaptive mode is enabled. This 
      value must be longer than 'EGO start wait'. 
      Adapt_stepmax Gasoline: Adaptive Learn Step Maximum 
      adapt_store_EE This switch determines whether the adaptive learn tables 
      (gasoline, LPG, and NG) are retained in battery supported memory or 
      permanent memory.

      In battery supported memory, the adaptive tables will be cleared if the 
      battery power is removed from the ECM.

      In permanent memory, a key-on reset sequence must be performed to clear 
      the tables.

      ratio before allowing adaptive updates. This tolerance must be held for 
      Adapt_valid_cycles before actual updates will begin.

      yields a quieter and more accurate derivative, but introduces more time 
      lag. Fewer points has the opposite effect.

      AFILTdP Air filter final filtered delta-P 
      AFILTdP_cyl_events Enter the number of cylinder events to use for AFILTdP 
      measurement windowing. Lower values result in faster sensor response, 
      higher values minimize the engine-related pulsations. Set this value to 
      0.0 to disable cylinder event based windowing. Otherwise, this value must 
      be >= 1 if cylinder and the max window is limited to 2ms.

      input channels.

      delta-P sensor, applied prior to low-pass filtering. If the difference 
      between the instantaneous dP and low-passed dP reading is below this 
      value, the error is reduced via a cubic deadzone before being applied to 
      the low-passed dP.

      differential pressure sensor. 
      AFILT_dP_chan_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). An active state for this input 
      indicates that the differential pressure across the air filter is high.

      afs_crkdly_cycs If the ECT is between the upper and lower (exclusive) 
      thresholds above, the fuel and/or spark will be inhibited (delayed) for 
      this number of engine cycles during starting on alternate-fuels (LPG and

      AMTSA_dec_torq_est Parameter adjusts the broadcasted actual engine torque 
      (SPN 513) during the decreasing TSC1 torque limit at the beginning of an 
      AMT upshift. When set to 0%, the broadcasted engine torque is not modified 
      and is equal to the estimated engine torque. When parameter is set to 
      100%, the broadcasted engine torque is modified and is set equal to the 
      desired engine torque (typically equal to the AMT's requested torque 
      limit). When parameter is between 0% and 100%, then the broadcasted torque 
      is interpolated. This parameter is only applicable when "AMT shift assist" 
      is not set to 'Disabled' and the AMT sends TSC1 torque limits during 
      upshifts. 
      AMTSA_down_dis_FSO When set to 'Enabled', parameter temporarily disables 
      fuel shutoff when a downshift is pending/in progress. 
      AMTSA_ena Parameter enables the AMT shift assistance feature (AMTSA). When 
      set to 'Enabled', shift assistance detects AMT upshift events and provides 
      various system modifications to improve the smoothness of the shift. 
      Currently, only AMTs that send TSC1 torque limit requests during an 
      upshift are supported. The upshift should start with a torque limit to 
      reduce the engine torque, followed by a speed request to synchronize the 
      engine speed, and finally another torque limit to increase engine torque. 
      The actual and desired gears (SPNs 523 and 524 in ETC2, ECI PGN 61572) are 
      used to determine if the shift is an upshift. The 'AMT selection' must be 
      enabled. The source address of the AMT is determined by 'AMT selection'. 
      AMTSA_loadlim Current load limit for AMT shift assistance. 
      AMTSA_loadlim_ena Enables load limiting for AMT shift assistance. 
      AMTSA_loadlim_gear Transmission gear used for calculating the load limit 
      for AMT shift assistance. 
      AMTSA_minnom AMT shift assist's EGR min/nom fraction request. 
      AMTSA_minnom_ena Parameter enables EGR min/nom fraction limiting during an 
      AMT upshift. When parameter is set to 'Enabled', the EGR min/nom fraction 
      is limited to the gear-based "Min/Nom Target" value in the "AMT Upshift 
      Assist Decreasing Torque" table during the decreasing TSC1 torque limit. 
      The EGR min/nom fraction is slewed to the target over the "AMT shift 
      assist EGR min/nom slew time". Parameter is only applicable when "AMT 
      shift assist" is not set to 'Disabled'. 
      AMTSA_minnom_time Configures the amount of time to slew the EGR min/nom 
      fraction to the AMT shift assist target during an AMT upshift. Only 
      applicable when "AMT shift assist EGR min/nom" is set to 'Enabled'. 
      AMTSA_state AMT shift assist state:
      0 = 'Disabled' - feature disabled (AMTSA_ena or AMT_select disabled)
      1 = 'Gear Not Available' - gear data not available or gear unknown
      2 = 'Gear Data Error' - gear data in error
      3 = 'Engine Stopped' - engine is not running or key is off
      4 = 'Park or Neutral' - actively (or desired to be) in park or neutral
      5 = 'Inactive' - waiting for upshift
      6 = 'Verifying Shift' - received torque limit, waiting up to 120ms for 
      desired gear to change
      7 = 'Verifying Shift Wait' - shift verification failed, wait for gear to 
      change or torque limit to decrease
      8 = 'Upshift - Decreasing Torque' - upshift in progress, AMT is decreasing 
      engine torque
      9 = 'Upshift - Speed Sync Wait' - upshift in progress, waiting for AMT to 
      synchronize engine speed
      10 = 'Upshift - Syncing Speed' - upshift in progress, AMT is synchronizing 
      engine speed
      11 = 'Upshift - Torque Increase Wait' - upshift in progress, waiting for 
      AMT to increase engine torque
      12 = 'Upshift - Increasing Torque' - upshift in progress, AMT is 
      increasing engine torque
      13 = 'Launch - Decreasing Torque' - launch in progress, AMT is decreasing 
      engine torque
      14 = 'Launch - Syncing Speed' - launch in progress, AMT is synchronizing 
      engine speed
      15 = 'Launch - Increasing Torque' - launch in progress, AMT is increasing 
      engine torque
      16 = 'Downshift - Decreasing Torque' - downshift in progress, AMT is 
      decreasing engine torque
      17 = 'Downshift - Syncing Speed' - downshift in progress, AMT is 
      synchronizing engine speed
      18 = 'Downshift - Increasing Torque' - downshift in progress, AMT is 
      increasing engine torque 
      AMTSA_TPSd_filt_ena Enables TPS command filtering during an AMT upshift. 
      When set to 'Decrease Only', the TPS command (TPS_cmd_pct) is filtered at 
      the beginning of an upshift when the AMT sends a TSC1 torque limit to 
      decrease the engine torque. The filter's tau is equal to the gear-based 
      "TPSd Filter Tau" value in the "AMT Upshift Assist Decreasing Torque" 
      table. The duration of the filtering is limited to the gear-based "TPSd 
      Filter Max Time" table value.

      When set to 'Increase Only', TPS command filtering only occurs during the 
      increasing TSC1 torque limit at the end of an upshift. The filter's tau 
      and max time are determined by the gear-based values in the "AMT Upshift 
      Assist Increasing Torque" table.

      When set to 'Both', then TPS command filtering occurs during decreasing 
      and increasing torque limits.

      This parameter is only applicable when "AMT shift assist" is not set to 
      'Disabled' and the AMT sends TSC1 torque limits during upshifts. 
      AMTSA_WGPd_ena Parameter enables wastegate pressure limiting during an AMT 
      upshift. When parameter is set to 'Enabled', the wastegate pressure is 
      limited to the gear-based "WGPd Max" value in the "AMT Upshift Assist 
      Increasing Torque" table during the increasing TSC1 torque limit. The 
      limit is applied to bst_WGPdi which is the wastegate actuator desired 
      pressure from the TIP control loop. Parameter is only applicable when "AMT 
      shift assist" is not set to 'Disabled'. 
      AMT_Gov3_acc_init Some AMT's use TSC1 for the shift process. Following a 
      TSC1 load limit to no-load, a brief TSC1 full authority speed control 
      target is sent to synchronize the engine and transmission.

      When transitioning to Gov3 speed control with a TSC1 speed request from 
      the source address specified by "AMT selection", the Gov3 integrator will 
      be reset to this value to prevent unwanted load spikes due to stored 
      history in the integral accumulator. Set to -1 to disable. Typical values 
      are 1-10%.

      Parameter only applicable when "AMT selection" is not 'Disabled'. 
      AMT_Gov3_acc_maxload Maximum engine load for the Gov3 integrator reset 
      described by parameter "AMT TSC1 Gov3 initial integrator". This is 
      intended to prevent unpredictable governor behavior and only allow 
      integrator resetting at low load operation. Parameter only applicable when 
      "AMT selection" is not 'Disabled'. 
      AMT_Gov3_gain_down Parameter determines the Gov3 gain selection to use 
      during the speed synchronization phase of an AMT downshift. When set to 
      'Default', Gov3 gains are determined based on the "Governor gain 
      selection" on the Governor worksheet as well as the "'Remote speed request 
      throttle gov parameters" on the Comms worksheet. Otherwise, the Gov3 gains 
      are overridden with this parameter's calibrated gain set when the AMT 
      sends a TSC1 speed control request during a downshift. A downshift is 
      detected using SPN 574 in ETC1 and SPNs 523 and 524 in ETC2. Gov3 gains 
      will only be overridden if the specified SPNs are received and valid. 
      AMT_Gov3_gain_lnch Parameter determines the Gov3 gain selection to use 
      during an AMT vehicle launch. When set to 'Default', Gov3 gains are 
      determined based on the "Governor gain selection" on the Governor 
      worksheet as well as the "'Remote speed request throttle gov parameters" 
      on the Comms worksheet. Otherwise, the Gov3 gains are overridden with this 
      parameter's calibrated gain set when the AMT sends a TSC1 speed control 
      request during a launch. A launch is detected using SPN 574 in ETC1 and 
      SPNs 523 and 524 in ETC2. Gov3 gains will only be overridden if the 
      specified SPNs are received and valid. 
      AMT_Gov3_gain_up Parameter determines the Gov3 gain selection to use 
      during the speed synchronization phase of an AMT upshift. When set to 
      'Default', Gov3 gains are determined based on the "Governor gain 
      selection" on the Governor worksheet as well as the "'Remote speed request 
      throttle gov parameters" on the Comms worksheet. Otherwise, the Gov3 gains 
      are overridden with this parameter's calibrated gain set when the AMT 
      sends a TSC1 speed control request during an upshift. An upshift is 
      detected using SPN 574 in ETC1 and SPNs 523 and 524 in ETC2. Gov3 gains 
      will only be overridden if the specified SPNs are received and valid. 
      AMT_input_speed ETC1 transmission input shaft speed 
      AMT_neut_coast_CCVS Parameter configures the broadcasted CCVS message 
      values whenever cruise control is suspended by the clutch. When "AMT 
      neutral coasting" is enabled, cruise control is temporarily suspended 
      while the clutch pedal is depressed. When clutch is released, cruise 
      control will automatically resume. This parameter configures the CCVS 
      status while cruise control is suspended. When parameter is set to 
      'Inactive (Default)', then the following SPNs values are broadcasted while 
      cruise control is suspended by the clutch:
      SPN 527 (cruise control state) = 0 (off/disabled)
      SPN 595 (cruise control active) = 0 (inactive)
      SPN 596 (cruise control enable switch) = 1 (enabled)
      SPN 86 (cruise control set speed) = maximum roadspeed limit
      When clutch is released, the roadspeed setpoint will initialize to the 
      current roadspeed and slew up to the setpoint prior to suspension (typical 
      resume behavior).

      When parameter is set to 'Active and Holding', then the following SPNs 
      values are broadcasted while cruise control is suspended by the clutch:
      SPN 527 (cruise control state) = 1 (holding)
      SPN 595 (cruise control active) = 1 (active)
      SPN 596 (cruise control enable switch) = 1 (enabled)
      SPN 86 (cruise control set speed) = roadspeed setpoint before cruise 
      control was suspended
      When clutch is released, the roadspeed setpoint will remain unchanged. 
      AMT_neut_coast_mode Enables neutral coasting with the WABCO AMT. Cruise 
      control will not be disengaged when the transmission is in neutral while 
      the operator has selected a gear, and cruise control can be temporarily 
      suspended while the clutch pedal is depressed. 
      AMT_output_speed ETC1 transmission output shaft speed 
      AMT_RSC_suspend Indicates WABCO AMT Suspend Cruise status. AMT neutral 
      coasting must be set to "WABCO" to use this feature. 
      AMT_select Parameter configures the AMT's source address. Application 
      specific AMT parameters are utilized when TSC1 requests with the specified 
      source address are received. 
      AMT_shift_in_process ECT1 transmission shift in process indicator 
      AMT_speed_purpose The purpose for an AMT TSC1 speed control request:
      0 = 'Inactive'
      1 = 'Active - Exit Neutral'
      2 = 'Active - Launch'
      3 = 'Active - Upshift'
      4 = 'Active - Downshift'
      5 = 'Active - Unknown' 
      AMT_torq_lmt Received AMT TSC1 torque limit. AMT source address determined 
      based on 'AMT selection' parameter.

      AOSB_Kd This value is multiplied by the difference between the actual 
      dPS/dt and the limit values defined by the min/max PS PSdt parameters and 
      the current PS (from max to max-delta). For example, if the current dPS/dt 
      = +200 %/s, the actuator is about to impact the open-stop, and the min PS 
      PSdt parameter is +100 %/s, then for a Kd value of 1.0 %/%*sec, the 
      contribution to the braking force will be -100%. 
      AOSB_max_APSdt dPS/dt value at the min PS (full-open minus open-stop PS 
      delta) position below which no braking action will occur. This must be a 
      value strictly > 0 and should be more positive than the min PS PSdt value. 

      AOSB_min_APSdt dPS/dt value at the max PS (full-open) position below which 
      no braking action will occur. This must be a value strictly > 0.

      autocrk_reset When enabled, a valid start signal will reset the auto-crank 
      system (after reaching cumulative crank-time limit, engine stall, engine 
      shutdown, etc.). If this option is disabled, a key-cycle is required to 
      reset the auto-crank system. Auto-crank must be enabled and the "Start 
      signal input" must not be set to "Disabled (key-on)" for this feature to 
      work. 
      autocrk_starttmr If enabled, the auto-crank timer will wind-up whenever 
      the starter is engaged. The default strategy is to only wind-up the 
      auto-crank timer when engine speed is detected. This option should only be 
      used in auto-crank mode, and not in starter lockout mode. 
      autocrk_trig When "Starter control mode" is set to 'N/O Auto-crank mode', 
      this selects the input channel that will "trigger" an auto-crank cycle to 
      begin attempting to start the engine. If this value is set to 'Disabled 
      (key-on)', then an auto-crank start attempt will begin as soon as 
      key-switch power is on.

      When "Starter control mode" is set to 'N/O Starter-Lockout Pass-thru' 
      mode, starting will be inhibited until a signal is seen on this input. If 
      this value is set to 'Disabled (key-on)', then starting will be allowed as 
      soon as key-switch power is on.

      When applicable, this input is also used by the "Transmission in-gear 
      override limit" feature to detect extended cranking. 
      autocrk_trig_valid Indicates the start command status. 
      autocrk_trig_windup Determines how the auto-crank wind-up timer triggers 
      auto-crank events.

      If set to 'When zero', the start signal engages auto-crank when the engine 
      is stopped. Thereafter, the start signal is ignored, and an auto-crank 
      event is triggered whenever the wind-up timer is zero.

      If set to 'Override', an auto-crank event is triggered whenever the 
      wind-up timer is zero and the start signal is valid. The crank limiter 
      wind-up time limit will be ignored for an active auto-crank event while 
      the start signal remains valid.

      If set to 'Start signal when zero', an auto-crank event is triggered 
      whenever the wind-up timer is zero and the start signal is valid.

      For all settings, the cumulative crank-time limit will still be enforced, 
      and a key-cycle is required to re-initialize cranking once the cumulative 
      crank-time limit is reached.

      AUX_start_chan This switch enables engine start via an auxiliary input. 
      The output is implemented on the 'starter lockout' control pin but with 
      inverse logic to the starter lockout. This input is only functional if the 
      "Starter control mode" is set to 'N/O Auto-Crank Mode' or 'N/O 
      Starter-Lockout Pass-Thru'.

      Auto-crank is not implemented for this input method. If the "Starter 
      control mode" is normally 'N/O Auto-Crank Mode' then starter control will 
      operate as if in the 'N/O Starter-Lockout Pass-Thru' mode while this input 
      is active (e.g. the starter will only remain on while this input is held 
      active).

      AUX_start_chan_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s).

      BP_def Default value of Barometric Pressure (BP) 
      BP_est_ena This flag tells the software whether or not to use MAP/TOP 
      based BP estimation for calculating actual BP. If this flag='MAP/TOP 
      estimate / BP present', the MAP/TOP signal is used in the normal way to 
      estimate BP in psia. If this flag='BP absent / EBP estimate', MAP/TOP 
      based BP estimation is NOT done and the BP_def pressure is used as the 
      actual BP in psia. The 'internal sensor' option is only available on ECM 
      platforms with an on-board barometric pressure sensor. 
      NOTE: If MAP_sensor='Not Present', BP estimation is not done regardless of 
      the BP_disable switch state. If a TOP sensor is not present (i.e. not a 
      supercharged application), the TOP based estimate defaults to a MAP based 
      estimate. 
      BP_internal_comp internal (compensated) barometric pressure reading in 
      psia 
      BP_key_halt If Key-on timer (key_on_tmr) is between BP_key_wait and this 
      parameter, MAP or TOP may be used to generate an initial value of BP 
      BP_key_wait If Key-on timer (key_on_tmr) is between this parameter AND 
      BP_key_halt, MAP or TOP may be used to generate an initial value of BP 
      BP_LPEGR_tau Specifies the time constant for the low-pass filter applied 
      to the barometric pressure input. The output of this filter is used 
      exclusively for low-pressure EGR flow calculations and diagnostics. This 
      low-pass filter is applied to any BP input source configured by the "BP 
      estimate/measurement" parameter on the Altitude worksheet. 

      Small changes (~0.1 psi) to BP can result in sudden significant changes to 
      calculated EGR flow. Applying a low-pass filter with a large time constant 
      to the BP input will result in smoother, more gradual changes to the EGR 
      flow. 
      BP_MAP_H MAP low limit for BP estimation; If MAP/TOP is above this limit, 
      BP estimation may be performed.

      brake_chan This input may be attached to an emergency brake for governor 
      interlock validation and secondary foot pedal control. However, it is 
      treated as a foot brake input in J1939 communications, and used as a 
      cruise-control disable. When parameter is set to 'J1939 EBC1', the input 
      is received in SPN 1121 (ECI SPN 561) from the following messages:

      brakes disagree 
      brake_open_released Foot brake input value (0=valid/depressed, 
      1=open/released) 
      brake_override_actv Indicates when the brake pedal override feature is 
      inhibiting foot pedal commands. 
      brake_override_mode When set to 'Enabled - Allow Brake TSC1', depressing 
      the brake pedal while the vehicle speed exceeds the "Brake override 
      minimum road speed" will disable all foot pedal commands, except for 
      braking TSC1 requests. A braking TSC1 request is defined as a negative or 
      zero torque or torque- limit request. Positive torque/torque-limit and 
      speed control requests are ignored. When set to 'Enabled - Allow All 
      TSC1', depressing the brake pedal while the vehicle speed exceeds the 
      "Brake override minimum road speed" will disable all foot pedal commands, 
      but allow all P32 TSC1 requests. Temporary powertrain control TSC1 
      requests are needed for AMT downshifting while the brake pedal is being 
      pressed. 
      brake_override_RSmin Minimum vehicle speed where depressing the brake 
      pedal disables foot pedal commands. 
      brake_sec_cfg This input is used for a foot or parking brake:
      Valid = Depressed
      Open = Released 
      brake_sec_chan Enter the secondary brake input channel, or 'Disabled' if 
      only 1 brake input exists. This is a redundant foot brake input used to 
      validate the primary brake input. If the two brake inputs disagree, the 
      "safe" scenario is chosen. For example, cruise control will be disabled if 
      either brake input reads a depressed brake pedal.

      BRV_comp_ena This feature reduces the EGR diluent command and/or the EGR 
      valve delta-P command during tip-outs to compensate for the opening of the 
      boost recirculation valve (BRV). 
      BRV_comp_ms Once activated, this determines how long the BRV compensation 
      will remain active. 
      BRV_comp_tmr If this value is non-zero, BRV compensation is active. This 
      timer is initialized to BRV_comp_ms when BRV compensation activates and 
      counts down to zero. 
      BRV_dilpct_reduct This parameter specifies the percent reduction in the 
      commanded diluent flow percentage while BRV compensation is active. 
      BRV_EGRvlv_dP This parameter can be used to limit the EGR valve delta-P 
      command while BRV compensation is active. Typically, 0.4-0.5 psi is 
      required for accurate open-loop EGR tracking. However, the delta-P can be 
      reduced via this parameter to help open the IRV, if needed. Set this 
      parameter to a value higher than the steady-state EGR valve dP table to 
      disable this feature. 
      BRV_MAPd_dtmin BRV compensation will activate if the MAPd derivative is 
      decreasing at a rate lower than this limit (tip-out) and TIP-MAPd is 
      increasing faster than the limit below. 
      BRV_TIPMAPd_dtmax BRV compensation will activate if the TIP-MAPd 
      derivative is increasing at a rate higher than this limit (BRV opening) 
      and MAPd is decreasing faster than the limit above (tip-out). 
      BRV_wait_ms Once BRV compensation is activated, this determines how long 
      the BRV compensation must be inactive (with both the MAPd and TIP-MAPd 
      derivatives below the activation thresholds) before it can re-activate.

      BstTIP_Lo_speed_exec If set to "Yes", the 'Control underboost 1' and

      discrete speed governing is active. For this governing mode, the "P 
      target" value used to evaluate the first two fault conditions for each 
      diagnostic is determined based on the "Boost Pressure Control Expected 
      TIP" table lookup (Monitors worksheet) using the current MAP.

      bst_appd_enabled Enables the “Boost delta approach” control feature. This 
      feature provides a mechanism to limit overboost and underboost by 
      temporarily adjusting and slewing the desired boost TIP target to slow the 
      approach. This adjusted “boost TIP desired approach” value (bst_TIPdapp) 
      is used when calculating the TIP error for PID control.

      The following options are available:

      - Disabled – the boost approach delta control feature is disabled. This is 
      the default.
      - Enabled – Upper and Lower – boost approach delta control is enabled for 
      both upper approach (underboost control) and lower approach (overboost 
      control).
      - Enabled – Upper only – boost approach delta control is enabled for upper 
      approach (underboost control) only.
      - Enabled – Lower only – boost approach delta control is enabled for lower 
      approach (overboost control) only. 
      bst_appd_lwr_delta Obsoleted parameter 
      bst_appd_lwr_d_pt The calculated lower delta point 
      bst_appd_lwr_mode Parameter sets the method for slewing up the TIP desired 
      approach value (bst_TIPdapp) to the actual TIP desired value (bst_TIPd). 
      When set to 'Slew up at constant rate', the approach value (bst_TIPdapp) 
      is slewed up to the actual value (bst_TIPd). When set to 'Slew to TIP 
      target', the difference between the actual value (bst_TIPd) and the 
      approach value (bst_TIPdapp) is slewed to 0. Changes in the actual value 
      (bst_TIPd) will be reflected in the approach value (bst_TIPdapp) while 
      slewing. 
      bst_appd_lwr_m_pt The calculated lower margin point 
      bst_appd_lwr_offset The boost TIP desired approach value (bst_TIPdapp) can 
      optionally be slewed to an offset from the actual boost TIP desired value 
      (bst_TIPd) for a specified duration of time, "Lower approach offset time". 
      This parameter specifies the offset. Set to 0 psi to disable. 
      bst_appd_lwr_slew Obsoleted parameter 
      bst_appd_lwr_slew_m This setting defines a margin below the lower approach 
      delta point at which slewing up to the actual boost TIP desired value 
      (bst_TIPd) will occur. This lower approach slew margin point allows 
      slewing to begin slightly below the delta point to prevent cases where TIP 
      may take excessively long to cross the delta point. Setting this value to 
      0 will result in slewing starting when TIP achieves or passes the delta 
      point. 
      bst_appd_lwr_time Amount of time to hold the boost TIP desired approach 
      value (bst_TIPdapp) at the lower approach offset point. When time has 
      expired, the TIP desired approach value will finish slewing to the actual 
      boost TIP desired value (bst_TIPd). See "Lower approach offset" for more 
      details. 
      bst_appd_upr_delta When TIP is higher than the desired boost TIP target 
      plus the “Upper approach delta” plus the “Upper approach slew margin” the 
      desired boost TIP target will be temporarily set to the delta point. 
      bst_appd_upr_d_pt The calculated upper delta point 
      bst_appd_upr_m_pt The calculated upper margin point 
      bst_appd_upr_slew This setting defines a margin above the upper approach 
      delta point at which slewing down to the actual boost TIP desired value 
      (bst_TIPd) will occur. This upper approach slew margin point allows 
      slewing to begin slightly above the delta point to prevent cases where TIP 
      may take excessively long to cross the delta point. Setting this value to 
      0 will result in slewing starting when TIP achieves or passes the delta 
      point. 
      bst_appd_upr_slew_m This setting defines a margin above the upper approach 
      delta point at which slewing down to the actual boost TIP desired value 
      (bst_TIPd) will occur. This upper approach slew margin point allows 
      slewing to begin slightly above the delta point to prevent cases where TIP 
      may take excessively long to cross the delta point. Setting this value to 
      0 will result in slewing starting when TIP achieves or passes the delta 
      point. 
      bst_BP_enabled This feature reduces the target TIP and potentially MAP at 
      high-altitudes. The TIP target will not be reduced below BP + 1.0 psia, to 
      avoid setting the TIP target to an unachievable condition. A phi 
      multiplier is applied via the following formula to allow constant power 
      operation:

      Phi_altitude = Phi_base * [1 + (dPhi/dTIP) fraction * 
      TIP_reduction/TIP_nominal]

      This feature is ignored for supercharged applications and during boost EMP 
      mode operation. The spark timing offset is also useful for naturally 
      aspirated applications, and can be used even when boost is disabled.

      If the TIP-only option is selected, once TIP is reduced to the boost MAP 
      target, the TIP reduction is frozen and no further reductions occur (power 
      maintain mode). If the TIP+MAP option is selected, once TIP is reduced to 
      the boost MAP target, the TIP and MAP targets will be simultaneously 
      reduced (overspeed protection mode).

      If the "Load-Limit & EGR MinNom: 2D Table" option is selected, the TIP 
      target and phi multiplier are not used. Instead, the same tables are 
      reused to apply a load-limit and EGR MinNom limit. In this mode, the spark 
      timing offset is ignored.

      The "Load-Limit & EGR MinNom: 2D Table with Load Threshold" option is 
      similar to the "Load-Limit & EGR MinNom: 2D Table" option, with these 
      differences:
      - The "Spark Timing Offset / MAP Load Threshold" table and "MAP load 
      approach delta" specify a MAP load window for slewing to the altitude EGR 
      min/nom fraction, and for calculating a derate percentage due to EGR 
      octane adaptation.
      - A low-pass filter can be applied to the load limit.

      bst_BP_lim Boost limit based on barometric pressure 
      bst_BP_LL_tau Tau for the load limit percentage requested by the altitude 
      compensation system. This parameter is only used when "Boost altitude 
      compensation" is set to "Load-Limit & EGR MinNom: 2D Table with Load 
      Threshold". 
      bst_BP_loadlim Current load limit percentage requested by the altitude 
      compensation system. 
      bst_BP_MAP_load MAP load threshold where the altitude EGR min/nom fraction 
      is fully active. This threshold is also used for calculating the "Derate 
      for EGR octane adaptation". 
      bst_BP_MAP_load_app Approach threshold for slewing to the altitude EGR 
      min/nom fraction. 
      bst_BP_MAP_load_dlt Delta for calculating the "Map load approach 
      threshold". The "MAP load approach threshold" = MAP load interpolated from 
      the "MAP Load Threshold" table, minus the delta. 
      bst_BP_oct_derate Additional derate to account for additional EGR added 
      for octane adaptation. The derate is calculated as the change in MAP 
      caused by the additional diluent as a percentage of the MAP no-load to 
      full-load range. The additional diluent is calculated at the current MAP 
      load threshold. 
      bst_BP_phifrac Boost altitude compensation phi fraction for Phi_alt = 
      Phi_base * (1 + Bst_BP_phifrac) 
      bst_carb_dP_ena If enabled, the boost delta-P target mode will account for 
      the pressure drop across a variable-venturi carburetor when computing the 
      throttle position to achieve the desired MAP and TIP targets. This 
      parameter is ignored while operating in the TIP absolute and EMP modes. 
      bst_dCdA_margin This value is used to provide a fixed CdA margin near 
      fully-closed throttle positions, in order to keep the off-zero response 
      reasonable. For example, if the throttle is almost closed and

      this value = 5% max CdA
      CdA,current = 0.005 (estimated from current position)
      CdA,slewed = 0.010 (estimated from CdA,current + 250 g/sec/sec * 5ms)
      CdA,100% = 4.0 (from the throttle calibration)

      then the actual CdA limit used will be
      max (0.010, 0.05*4.0) = 0.2

      With this value set to 0 in the above example, the throttle could get 
      'stuck' or take a significantly longer time than desired to open since the 
      limited resolution of the throttle model calibration could result in 
      almost identical TPS% values for CdA values of 0.005 and 0.010. 
      bst_discrete_gov By default, the TIP target is generated from the load 
      command (FPP). In discrete speed governing modes, FPP is typically 0% and 
      the target TIP is reduced (i.e. full power is not achieved). If 
      full-authority mode is selected, the load command is set to 100% (max 
      boost) and the throttle is used for governing. This option must be enabled 
      to achieve full-power when using the PTO feature (note it is also required 
      when using the PTO w/the min governor settings). 
      bst_dmdot_inc The throttle opening rate will be automatically limited to 
      ensure the change in flow across the throttle is below this limit. 
      bst_dPd delta-P value for delta P Wastegate control 
      bst_dP_EMP_Ki Obsoleted parameter 
      bst_dP_limit_active NO/YES logical indicating that delta P TPS limiting is 
      active/engaged 
      bst_dP_limit_ena If enabled, the delta-P limit below will be enforced as 
      the minimum TIP-MAP target. For example, the MAP target will be 
      upper-limited by MAPd <= TIP - bst_dP_limit_min. This parameter is ignored 
      while operating in the TIP absolute and EMP modes. 
      bst_dP_limit_min This parameter is ignored while operating in the TIP 
      absolute and EMP modes. 
      bst_dP_surge delta P across throttle that results in compressor surge. As 
      a result, bst_DPd should be less than this value to prevent a surge event 
      from occurring. 
      bst_EMPd_max Maximum exhaust manifold pressure to prevent engine choking 
      bst_EMPd_min minimum exhaust manifold pressure in psia for adequate EGR 
      control

      bst_Kiv_dis_time Parameter is the amount of time to slew "TIP feedback 
      Kiv" gain to 0 when the gain is disengaged. Gain is disengaged when the 
      TIP feedback error is less than "TIP feedback Kiv disengage error". 
      bst_Kiv_dis_TIPe The TIP feedback error must be less than this parameter 
      to disengage the "TIP feedback Kiv" gain once gain is engaged. Set to -128 
      psi to never disengage the "TIP feedback Kiv" gain.

      bst_MAPd_dt Boost MAPd derivative estimate. 
      bst_MAPd_dttau A low-pass filtered version of the MAPd derivative is used 
      in low-pressure EGR applications. This time constant specifies the 
      low-pass filter to apply to the 2-point backward difference derivative. 
      bst_MAPd_load Boost MAP load desired 
      bst_MAPd_load_max Parameter is a theoretical calculation of "Boost MAP 
      load desired" that assumes "Boost target load command" was at 100%. 
      Parameter is an estimate of the immediately available MAP-load for the 
      current engine conditions (TIP, altitude, EGR, etc.). Estimation does not 
      include load limits or remote torque requests. Parameter is currently only 
      calculated for turbocharged engines where "Boost control mode" set to 
      'delta-P'. Value can be used to calculate SPN 3357 "Actual Maximum 
      Available Engine Torque Percent" in EEC2. See "J1939 max available torque 
      broadcast" for details. 
      bst_MAP_surge MAP estimate for compressor surge. As a result, bst_MAPd 
      should be less than this value to prevent surge 
      bst_MAT_derate Boost target derate multiplier based on MAT derate 
      bst_mode Selected boost control mode. TIP absolute = TIP target only, 
      delta-P = MAP target based with TPS/TIP control. 
      bst_Ptarg_FSO Legacy variable 
      bst_Ptarg_P Active delta P or TIP target value from Lookup table 
      bst_rpm Filtered engine speed used for interpolating boost target pressure 
      and boost throttle command computations. 
      bst_rpm_tau Time constant for engine speed used in boost throttle command 
      calculations. Note that this is a second-order filter of the 
      window-averaged rpm.

      This parameter is ignored while operating in the TIP absolute mode. 
      bst_supercharge Turbocharged selection assumes the throttle is downstream 
      of the turbocharger, and throttle inlet pressure and WGP sensors are 
      available. Supercharged selection implies the throttle is upstream of the 
      turbocharger, and a throttle-outlet sensor is available.

      bst_TIPMAPd_dt Boost TIP-MAPd derivative estimate. 
      bst_TIPMAPd_dttau A low-pass filtered version of the TIP-MAPd derivative 
      is used in low-pressure EGR applications. This time constant specifies the 
      low-pass filter to apply to the 2-point backward difference derivative. 
      bst_TIP_atten_psi Parameter sets the TIP feedback error threshold for TIP 
      control gain attenuation. When the absolute value of the TIP feedback 
      error is less than this parameter's value, then the associated Kp, Ki, and 
      Kd control gains are attenuated.

      The PID gains are attenuated linearly from 100% to a calibratable 
      percentage of their original value. The following parameters set the TIP 
      control gains when the TIP feedback error is zero:
      "TIP Kp percentage when error zero"
      "TIP Ki percentage when error zero"
      "TIP Kd percentage when error zero"

      Set this parameter to 0 psi to disable all gain attenuation. To disable a 
      specific gain's attenuation, set the respective TIP gain percentage when 
      error is zero to 100%. 
      bst_TIP_Iacc_high TIP integrator high 
      bst_TIP_Iacc_low TIP integrator low 
      bst_TIP_Iacc_mode Configures the method for limiting the TIP control 
      loop's integrator. When set to 'Legacy' mode, the integrator is allowed to 
      wind up/down to the controller's limits, regardless of the proportional 
      and derivative term contributions. The summation of PID terms may be 
      outside the controller's limits. When set to 'Enhanced' mode, the 
      integrator can wind up/down to the controller's limits, but is limited by 
      the proportional and derivative contributions. The summation of PID terms 
      cannot be outside of the controller's limits. 
      bst_TIP_surge TIP estimate for compressor surge. As a result, bst_TIPd 
      should be less than this value to prevent surge 
      bst_TIP_tau Time constant for TIP used in boost throttle command 
      calculations. Note that this is the time constant for a second-order 
      filter; the first-order filter uses the standard slow low-pass time 
      constant.

      This parameter is ignored while operating in the TIP absolute mode.

      bst_TPS_dmdot_ena If enabled, the boost TPS command will be slew-rate 
      limited by the change in mass flow across the throttle. 
      bst_TPS_filt This parameter controls low-pass filters for the engine speed 
      and TIP measurement used in the boost throttle command compuations. 
      Filtered engine speed and TIP measurement used for each setting:
      - Disabled: "rpm slow average" (rpm_filt) and "TIP slow value" (TIP_slow)
      - Both rpm and TIP: low-passed rpm_filt using the "Boost TPS command rpm 
      tau", and low-passed TIP_slow using "Boost TPS command TIP tau"
      - rpm only, TIP unfiltered: "rpm slow average" (rpm_filt) and unfiltered 
      TIP. This is the recommended setting.

      This parameter is ignored while operating in the TIP absolute mode. 
      bst_WGAact Wastegate actuator feedback fraction 
      bst_WGAact_tau This time-constant is used to low-pass the WGA command and 
      estimate the WGA position when feedback is not available. 
      bst_WGAchan Parameter sets the wastegate actuator output channel.

      When set to 'CAN-based WGCV', the ECM does not directly control the 
      wastegate actuator or even the pressure control loop. A CAN-based 
      wastegate control valve (WGCV) receives the desired wastegate pressure 
      (bst_WGPd) from the ECM and performs closed loop control with its own 
      pressure sensor and valve. This option requires the "WGP source" to be set 
      to 'CAN-based WGCV' on the Inputs worksheet. The following ECI PGNs are 
      required: 65409, and 42285-42286. The following SPNs are required: 
      64766-64770. 
      bst_WGAcmd Wastegate actuator command fraction 
      bst_WGAcmd_DC Wastegate actuator command PWM duty cycle 
      bst_WGAcmd_FF Feedforward constant used when no WGP feedback is available 
      from the wastegate actuator (Ki=0 and Kd=0). 
      bst_WGAcmd_FF_source Select the source, either a static Single Point value 
      or a dynamically determined value from the 2D WGP Feedforward Command 
      table. This value will be used as the feedforward constant when a WGP 
      sensor is not available in the wastegate actuator. 
      bst_WGAcmd_FF_tbl The dynamically determined value from the WGP 
      Feedforward Command 2D table which is used when the bst_WGAcmd_FF_source 
      is set to 'Table Based'.

      low-pass filter. 
      bst_WGAcmd_V Wastegate actuator command voltage 
      bst_WGAVmax Wastegate actuator max control voltage. This is the voltage at 
      which no further increase in voltage will cause an increase in valve 
      position. 
      bst_WGAVmin Wastegate actuator min control voltage. This is the voltage at 
      which no further reduction in voltage will cause a decrease on valve 
      position.

      bst_WGPd_dot WGP desired derivative 
      bst_WGPd_dotena Enables/disables use of an estimated WGP derivative target 
      based on a backward difference from the TIP feedback loop. 
      bst_WGPd_tau Time constant for desired WGP output low-pass. 
      bst_WGPe Wastegate pressure control loop error term = bst_WGPd - bst_WGPa. 

      bst_WGPneut Pressure at which the wastegate actuator is in a neutral 
      position (balanced between full open and full closed positions). 
      bst_WGPnl_ena Enabled/disable the non-linear WGP target pressure mapping 
      table. This function is used to linearize wastegate response. 
      bst_WGPsource Select the wastegate pressure source. 'TIP' indicates that 
      the pressure is sourced from the turbo compressor, and 'Constant Supply' 
      indicates that the pressure is sourced from the vehicle/engine compressed 
      air source. 
      bst_WGPsource_Pc This is the pressure of the constant supply for the 
      wastegate when this configuration is selected. 
      bst_WGPWM_per If the PWM output channel is 3 or 4, then a selectable 
      output pulse period (1/frequency) is available. If this parameter is set 
      to 0, then the output runs at the normal maximum frequency if 2 KHz (0.5 
      ms period), otherwise it may run at periods up to 52.0 ms in increments of 
      0.5 ms. 
      bst_WGPWM_type This switch controls the final output interpretation for 
      the WG
      control PWM output. In 'Electrical PWM' mode, the min/max voltage/% 
      specifications below work as voltage limits with Vbat compensation. In 
      mechanical mode, theses min/max limits are now interpreted as % (0-100) 
      limits on mechanical duty-cycle with no Vbat compensation. Any changes in 
      these values will require gain re-scaling for equivalent gain operation.

      This option is for single-leg PWM outputs only and is ignored if one of 
      the H-bridges is assigned as the current output channel. 
      bst_WGP_test Enable this mode to allow manual entry of the WGP desired 
      pressure.

      input to also function as an engine-stop command input. 
      BTN_stop_occurred indicator that a push button engine stop request is what 
      caused the engine to halt 
      BTN_stop_rpm_min The engine speed must be above this limit before the 
      push-button stop feature will work. 
      BTN_stop_wt Additional debounce time to validate an autocrank trigger 
      input push-button stop request before shutting down the engine. Note this 
      is in addition to the normal debounce time used on auxiliary inputs.

      C2ASpd_ena This switch enables the Cam2 input as an auxiliary speed 
      (frequency) input source. The variable C2ASpd_raw_freq is the computed 
      frequency in Hz. 
      C2ASpd_freq_raw Cam2 Aux Speed pulse input frequency 
      C2ASpd_hist_avg_t The length of time over which the roadspeed will be 
      sampled from pulse versus time data. This should be >= 20ms and <= 150ms. 
      C2ASpd_hist_tout Timeout value during lack of receiving pulses to label as 
      zero speed. This value should be >= 50ms and <= 190ms, and should also be 
      > the speed averaging window time. Typical value is 150ms - no real reason 
      to change.

      the diagnostic's temperature source is COT. 
      CAC_eta_lo_COT Temperature threshold entry condition for "CAC efficiency 
      lower than expected" diagnostic. The threshold is compared to either COT, 
      IAT, or TIAT, depending on the diagnostic's temperature source. Measured 
      temperature must be above this value for fault to be evaluated.

      lower than expected" diagnostic. Enter a value of 0 if a roadspeed sensor 
      is not present.

      expected" diagnostic.
      When set to 'COT', the COT, AAT, and TIAT inputs must be configured.
      When set to 'IAT', the IAT and TIP inputs must be configured.
      When set to 'TIAT', the TIAT and TIP inputs must be configured.

      See 'Inputs' worksheet to configure temperature and pressure sources. 
      CAC_eta_nom Charge Air Cooler Model: Nominal efficiency 
      CAD_camsync_to_TDCC This parameter above describes the distance between a 
      normal cam pulse (use the pulse closest to TDCC) and TDCC. For 
      shifted-pulse cam configurations, this parameter should be set to the 
      location of the 1st normal pulse following the shifted pulse. 
      CAD_crankcam_extra This is an additional calibration parameter used only 
      by certain crank-cam configurations.
      See the details below for the crank-cam modules that depend on this 
      parameter:1) Generic 6-2 crank, 6+1 cam: This parameter indicates the 
      position of the 'extra' cam pulse in CAD ATDCC. The cam1 sync tooth 
      position/phasing parameter above describes the distance between a normal 
      cam pulse (use the pulse closest to TDCC) and TDCC.2) Generic 6-2 crank, 
      4-pulse variable cam:This parameter describes how far the cam is advanced 
      from its nominal/standard configuration. It is only used for cam-syncing 
      with these patterns. Only positive values are accepted.

      The standard scenario ( for this parameter) looks at the cam state at the 
      crank tooth prior to the sync tooth. As an example, if this parameter is 
      set to 18 CAD, then the cam state from 4 (=18/6+1) crank teeth ago is used 
      for cam sync. Sync_allow must be greater than (this_parameter / 6 + 1).3) 
      For shifted-pulse cam configurations, this parameter should be set to the 
      amount of shift. Use positive values if the shifted pulse is delayed (i.e. 
      the cam tooth delta pattern is: normal delta, large delta, small delta, 
      normal delta) and negative values if the shifted pulse is advanced (i.e. 
      the cam tooth delta pattern is: normal delta, small delta, large delta, 
      normal delta). 
      CAD_sync_to_camtrust Obsoleted parameter 
      CAD_sync_to_TDCC Enter the CAD offset between the "sync" tooth and TDC 
      compression on cylinder #1. For gap-toothed wheels, sync is first achieved 
      on the second tooth after the final gap tooth. For example, if TDC#1 is 54 
      CAD after the last gap tooth (assigning 0 CAD to the final gap tooth and 
      +6 CAD to the first tooth after the gap) on a 60-2 pattern, enter 54 - 2*6 
      = 42 CAD for this value.

      Note this value should be fixed for a given application and adjustment is 
      not normally necessary. However, in the event the spark timing is off and 
      minor adjustment is necessary: increase this value to retard timing, and 
      decrease this value to advance timing.

      cam1_input_redirect This switch allows hardware edge events coming into 
      the Cam1 input pin to redirect to the Cam2 software handling routine. For 
      example, if a hardware platform does not have a physical (i.e. hardware) 
      Cam2 input channel but does have an available Cam1 input channel, this 
      switch can be set to Cam2 to make the platform behave as if the Cam1 input

      Camini_slew_tout This is the time over which the maximum cam control

      Camrat_ena During an impending cam fault auto-unlocking procedure, this 
      switch enables 'phase 2' of the strategy called the 'rattle' procedure. 
      This phase sends multiple short duration low/high current pulses to the 
      cam actuator to attempt to 'unstick' it and return normal operation. If 
      enabled, this phase is initiated at 50% of the fault counter latch time 
      following the phase 1 starting-current pulse and prior to the phase 3 
      high-current 'bump'. The low-pulse time and current are specified 
      constants, and the high-pulse time is constant with a linearly variable 
      current option from 'Camrat_hi_start_I' to 'Camrat_hi_end_I'. 
      Camrat_hi_end_I This is the ending cam actuator current commanded prior to 
      the falling edge of the last high-time pulse of the 'cam-rattle' phase 2 
      cam fault auto-unlocking procedure. The current linearly transitions from 
      the start value to this end value across the total high-time = total 
      pulses * high-time per pulse. 
      Camrat_hi_start_I This is the starting cam actuator current commanded 
      after the rising edge of the first high-time pulse of the 'cam-rattle' 
      phase 2 cam fault auto-unlocking procedure. The current linearly 
      transitions from this start value to the end value across the total 
      high-time = total pulses * high-time per pulse. 
      Camrat_hi_time This is the duration of the high-time during the 
      'cam-rattle' phase 2 cam fault auto-unlocking procedure. 
      Camrat_lo_I This is the cam actuator current during the low-time of the 
      'cam-rattle' phase 2 cam fault auto-unlocking procedure. 
      Camrat_lo_time This is the duration of the low-time during the 
      'cam-rattle' phase 2 cam fault auto-unlocking procedure. 
      Camrat_pulse_cnt This is the total number of 'cam-rattle' pulses to inject 
      during phase 2 of the cam fault auto-unlocking procedure. If this value is 
      set to zero, no pulses are generated. A typical value is 5 pulses which 
      would be 5 low periods and 5 high periods. 
      cam_capture Capture edge (rising or falling) used for cam1 sensing 
      cam_cnt_diag cam input diagnostic rolling tooth counter used by crank/cam 
      diagnostics 
      cam_err_rpm "Intake cam / distributor position" diagnostic minimum RPM 
      entry condition 
      cam_HW_cfg Cam input hardware interface configuration. 
      cam_level_sync This switch signals what the cam state should be at the 
      specified sync tooth. The opposite state implies that the engine is 360 
      CAD (1 rev) from the sync tooth. 
      cam_level_trust This parameter is only used on high-low cam modules that 
      experience cam signal dropout (e.g. axially mounted sensors with excessive 
      drop out).

      To enable this feature, set cam_trust_level to a non-zero value (e.g. 60 
      CAD). For these modules, the 'cam_level_trust' parameter should be set to 
      the minimum required consistent cam-level for syncing. For example, if 
      cam_level_sync =LOW and cam_level_trust = 60*16, then the system normally 
      has a low cam edge at the sync tooth and because of intermittent erroneous 
      high levels (e.g. axial mounted cam sensor that reads low when ferrous 
      material is in front of the sensor), the edge state at crank sync cannot 
      be trusted. For this situation, the cam must be LOW for 60 CAD, and once 
      it is, the sync state is transitioned from -1 to -2. No attempts are made 
      to check the cam sync after the initial transition to a -2 sync state, but 
      an erroneous gap location will completely resync the system. 
      cam_lock_state Cam1 lock state (>0=pre-lock, 0=stopped, -2=locked onto cam 
      signal) 
      Cam_pin_ena This switch enables retention pin unlocking logic.
      This logic is designed to attempt to 'unlock' a variable camshaft 
      retention pin after starting but before a fault is set for inability to 
      control the camshaft.
      This system works in concert with the 'Intake cam position error' and 
      'Exhaust cam position error' faults.
      After the cam engine-starting delays from above, if all conditions are 
      satisfied to set one of these faults, this logic will interject one or 
      more current pulse phases to attempt to restore normal cam control:Phase 
1)
      A single pulse of 'Cam engine-starting current' actuator command for a 
      duration of 'Cam fault phase1 start-current pulse time' when the fault 
      latch timer has exceeded either 25% or 50% of its latch time.
      If no additional phases are selected, this pulse will occur at 50% of the 
      latch time, otherwise at 25% of the latch time.
      In many instances, this single pulse is enough to cause the retention pin 
      to unlock.
      If this is successful, the fault latch time will not expire before the cam 
      becomes controllable - and therefore the fault will never set.Phase 2)
      If 'Cam fault phase2 rattle' is enabled and the cam did not unlock 
      following phase 1, this phase will start when the fault counter exceeds 
      50% of the latch time.Phase 3)
      If 'Cam fault phase3 bump' is enabled and the cam did not unlock following 
      phase 1 or 2, this phase will start when the fault counter exceeds 75% of 
      the latch time.This logic re-arms to allow another pulse interjection 
      chain whenever the fault latch timer has cleared completely and the engine 
      speed is either stopped or falls below the minimum required for the fault. 

      Cam_pin_tout This is the pulse duration for the interjection of "Cam 
      engine-starting current" during phase 1 of an impending cam position fault 
      that is designed to unlock a stuck cam retention pin. See the comments for 
      "Cam fault pin-unlocking logic" from above for more information. If this 
      value is set to zero, this phase (phase 1) of the unsticking logic will be 
      skipped and the logic will move on to phase 2 and phase 3 if those are 
      enabled. 
      cam_pos_CAD This is the estimated position of the cam sensor input 
      relative to the crank sensor. This function is typically used with 
      distributor engines for aligning the distributor. 
      cam_pos_std This is the estimated position of the cam sensor input 
      relative to the crank sensor. This function is typically used with 
      distributor engines for aligning the distributor. 
      cam_pos_tau Low-pass time constant for filtering/averaging the cam 
      position estimation. This function is typically used with distributor 
      engines for aligning the distributor. 
      cam_reqactv Some crank-cam software modules reference this parameter to 
      determine what type (if any) cam activity is required before sync'ing the 
      engine at start. 
      Cam_strt_I This current will be output on any selected cam phaser control 
      PWM channel during starting and until the run timer has exceeded the base 
      + additional timeouts below. 
      Cam_strt_textra ECT based extra delay on start for cam actuator engagement 
      (additive to Cam_strt_tout) 
      Cam_strt_tout The starting current will be output on any selected cam 
      phaser control PWM channel during starting and until the run timer has 
      reached this base value + any additional ECT based timeout from the 
      schedule below. The special value of zero for the combined timeouts causes 
      the cam to immediately begin active controlling on crank. A small value 
      (0.001 sec) will cause the starting current to be used during crank, but 
      will immediately begin active controlling at run speed. 
      cam_tooth_cnt Cam1 tooth counter, value is zero-based.

      CCH_active Logical indicating the crankcase heater is turned on. 
      CCH_CCTflt_cold_OILT Parameter is the temperature threshold for using the 
      "Crankcase heater open-loop long 'on' time max" instead of the standard 
      "Crankcase heater open-loop 'on' time max". 

      When "Crankcase heater open-loop control" is set to 'Enabled - AAT and 
      OILT', then parameter is compared to the oil temperature. If the oil 
      temperature sensor is not available or in a fault condition, then the 
      ambient air temperature is used instead.

      When "Crankcase heater open-loop control" is set to 'Enabled - AAT, IAT 
      key-on', then parameter is compared to the ambient air temperature. If the 
      ambient air temperature is not available or in a fault condition, then the 
      intake air temperature sampled at key-on is used instead. 
      CCH_chan Output channel for controlling a crankcase heater. 
      CCH_CL_control Parameter determines if closed-loop crankcase heater 
      control is enabled. When set to 'Disabled - Open-Loop Only', crankcase 
      heater control is forced to open-loop control. When set to 'Enabled', then 
      closed-loop control is enabled and the crankcase temperature (CCT) is used 
      as feedback for controller. If CCT is faulted, then controller is forced 
      into open-loop control. The following parameters are applicable when 
      closed-loop control is enabled and active:
      "Crankcase heater 'on' temperature"
      "Crankcase heater 'on' debounce time"
      "Crankcase heater 'off' temperature"
      "Crankcase heater 'off' debounce time" 
      CCH_flt_cold_tm Parameter is an alternative maximum time for the crankcase 
      heater to be on when open-loop control is active. See "Crankcase heater 
      open-loop long 'on' temp" for details. 
      CCH_flt_control Parameter determines which sensor inputs are used for 
      open-loop crankcase heater control.

      When set to 'Enabled - AAT and OILT', the ambient air temperature is used 
      to turn on and off the heater. The oil temperature is used to trigger a 
      longer 'on' time. See "Crankcase heater open-loop long 'on' temp" for 
      details.

      When set to 'Enabled - AAT, IAT key-on', the ambient air temperature is 
      used to turn on and off the heater. However, if ambient air temperature 
      sensor is not available or in a fault condition, then the intake air 
      temperature sampled at key-on is used. The ambient air temperature is also 
      used to trigger a longer 'on' time. 
      CCH_flt_off_temp Parameter is the ambient air temperature (AAT) at which 
      the crankcase heater turns off when open-loop control is active.

      When "Crankcase heater open-loop control" is set to 'Enabled - AAT, IAT 
      key-on' and AAT is not available or in a fault condition, then parameter 
      is compared to the intake air temperature sampled at key-on. 
      CCH_flt_off_tm Minimum time for the crankcase heater to be off when 
      open-loop control is active. 
      CCH_flt_on_temp Parameter is the ambient air temperature (AAT) at which 
      the crankcase heater turns on when open-loop control is active.

      When "Crankcase heater open-loop control" is set to 'Enabled - AAT, IAT 
      key-on' and AAT is not available or in a fault condition, then parameter 
      is compared to the intake air temperature sampled at key-on. 
      CCH_flt_on_tm Maximum time for the crankcase heater to be on when 
      open-loop control is active. 
      CCH_off_CCT Crankcase temperature (CCT) at which the crankcase heater 
      should be turned off. Parameter is only applicable when "Crankcase heater 
      closed-loop control" is set to 'Enabled'. 
      CCH_off_dly Minimum time that the crankcase temperature (CCT) must remain 
      above the turn-off temperature before turning off the crankcase heater. 
      Parameter is only applicable when "Crankcase heater closed-loop control" 
      is set to 'Enabled'. 
      CCH_on_CCT Crankcase temperature (CCT) at which the crankcase heater 
      should be turned on. Parameter is only applicable when "Crankcase heater 
      closed-loop control" is set to 'Enabled'. 
      CCH_on_dly Minimum time that the crankcase temperature (CCT) must remain 
      below the turn-on temperature before turning on the crankcase heater. 
      Parameter is only applicable when "Crankcase heater closed-loop control" 
      is set to 'Enabled'.

      CFV_dis_restrict This is the effective area of all restrictions downstream 
      of a CFV up to and including the fuel introduction ports. This effective 
      area (i.e. Cd * A) is used to compute the backpressure on the CFV relative 
      to the fuel discharge environment pressure as measured and communicated by 
      the ECM back to the CFV (i.e. TIP or MAP). 
      CFV_FSO_cmd Indicates whether fuel shut off should be commanded to the CFV 

      CFV_fuel_calc This switch determines the source of the fuel flow 
      calculation for the CFV. In 'Speed-density + dMAP/dt' mode, the intake 
      manifold filling portion of the total flow is computed using the intake 
      volume and the filtered dMAP/dt signal.
      In 'Throttle-model based' mode, the compressible flow through the 
      throttle-body using the MAP and TIP pressure signals are used during 
      transients and speed-density is only used during steady-state operation.
      These calculations are controlled by the parameters in the 'Throttle-Model 
      Based Throttle-Body Fueling' section.
      When specific MAP faults are enabled and faulted, the fuel flow

      (CFV_mdot_FS) 
      CFV_mdot_FS This is the full-scale fuel mass flow rate in g/sec used for a 
      CFV based continuous injection system. Fuel flow commands are transmitted 
      as a % of this value in order to properly scale the dynamic range of the 
      valve. A typical value of 32.0 g/sec will satisfy all installations up to 
      approximately 600 bhp. 
      CFV_mdot_pct_err CFV actual fuel flow vs. commanded flow error in pct of 
      commanded 
      CFV_mdot_pct_hi Difference between the commanded and actual CFV gaseous 
      fuel flow rate as a percentage of the commanded rate. The actual flow rate 
      must be greater than the commanded rate by this percentage. 
      CFV_mdot_pct_lo Difference between the commanded and actual CFV gaseous 
      fuel flow rate as a percentage of the commanded rate. The actual flow rate 
      must be less than the commanded rate by this percentage. NOTE: must be 
      negative number. 
      CFV_mdot_pct_rms The RMS is calculated from a rolling history of the CFV 
      gaseous fuel flow error values. The flow error is defined as the 
      difference between the commanded and actual fuel flow rate as a percentage 
      of the commanded rate. NOTE: The RMS percentage must be expressed as a

      CFV_Pdis_margin_kPa This is a differential positive pressure that is added 
      to the fuel discharge environment pressure (i.e. TIP or MAP) of a CFV fuel 
      system. This differential pressure is used to compensate for pressure 
      pulsations at the fuel introduction point to allow computation of 
      worst-case choking conditions across the CFV valve orifice. This value 
      will typically be 2 to 3 psid with 3 psid being recommended. 
      CFV_Pdis_min This is the minimum fuel discharge environment pressure (i.e. 
      TIP or MAP) sent by the ECM to the CFV. By limiting the minimum discharge 
      environment pressure, the calculated interstage pressure command is 
      limited. Limiting the minimum interstage pressure command can be used to 
      help improve interstage pressure control at low engine loads. Note: the 
      "CFV discharge pressure pulsation margin" is added after this parameter 
      limits the discharge environment pressure. 
      CFV_Pin_def_psig This is the estimated inlet gage pressure to the CFV. A 
      typical value is 85 psig. This value may help the CFV optimize its 
      performance through gain scaling, ... 
      CFV_Preg_HiExp Difference between the commanded and actual CFV internal 
      gaseous fuel regulation pressure on the positive (high) side that will 
      trigger a fault. 
      CFV_Preg_LoExp Difference between the commanded and actual CFV internal 
      gaseous fuel regulation pressure on the negative (low) side that will

      CFV_strtf_hold_cyc CFV starting fuel enrichment hold time. Full CFV 
      starting fuel enrichment is applied for this number of engine cycles 
      before the fuel flow command begins to be slewed back toward the base 
      command. 
      CFV_strtf_mult CFV starting fuel enrichment multiplier. The base fuel flow 
      command is multiplied by this value during starting, until the number of 
      engine cycles set by "CFV starting fuel crank cycles" is reached. 
      CFV_strtf_reset_tm Sets the minimum time that must elapse after CFV 
      starting fuel enrichment was applied before it can become active again. 
      This should be set large enough to prevent flooding the engine when it is 
      cranked multiple times without starting. This minimum time will not apply 
      if the engine starts successfully. 
      CFV_strtf_slew Sets the rate at which CFV starting fuel enrichment is 
      slewed out and the fuel flow command returns to its normal value.

      choke_add_mode Specifies which "Choke Fuel Adder" tables are used for the 
      various fuel types and fuel admission devices.

      Gasoline always uses the "Primary Choke Fuel Adder" table.

      When setting is 'Primary = Gasoline', after-start fuel enrichment is 
      disabled for gaseous fuels.

      When setting is 'Primary = Gasoline & Non-DEPR Gaseous', the following 
      gaseous fuel admission devices use the "Primary Choke Fuel Adder" table:
      Pulse Injection
      Continuous Injection
      MFG (only when "MFG fuel calculation mode" is not 'MFA mass flow')

      When setting is 'Primary = Gasoline, Secondary = Gaseous', the following 
      gaseous fuel admission devices use the "Secondary Choke Fuel Adder" table:
      Pulse Injection
      Continuous Injection
      MFG (only when "MFG fuel calculation mode" is not 'MFA mass flow')
      Carburetion (only when "Carburetor fuel trim device type" is 
      'MegaJector/EPR')

      Bi-fuel engines requiring after-start enrichment for both gasoline and 
      gaseous fuels must use 'Primary = Gasoline, Secondary = Gaseous'.

      When fuel is gasoline, choke fuel is added while cranking and running. 
      When fuel is gaseous and permitted by this setting, choke fuel is added 
      only while running.

      hysteresis to the first ROL post cat window when transitioning between ROL 
      and post-cat phi control. 
      CLLP_postcat_winpdlt This parameter is added to "ROL window high offset" 
      and the post-cat target phi to define an upper threshold for transitioning 
      to post-cat phi control. The purpose of this adder is to provide some 
      hysteresis to the first ROL post cat window when transitioning between ROL 
      and post-cat phi control. 
      CLLP_post_fastwr_tm This is the time that the closed loop fuel control 
      will be continuous when crossing between ROL temporary (mode 2) and 
      post-cat persistent (mode 1). 
      CLLP_ROLend_fastwrtm This is the time that the closed loop fuel control 
      will be continuous when crossing between ROL persistent (mode 0) and 
      post-cat temporary (mode 3). 
      CLLP_ROLend_tm_mode Parameter determines when the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont 
      CL time" parameter is used when changing the closed loop fuel control from 
      ROL persistent (mode 0) to post-cat temporary (mode 3). When set to 'Lean 
      Only', the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont CL time" is only used when crossing the 
      lower limit. When set to 'Lean or Rich', the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont CL 
      time" is used when crossing either the lower or upper limit.

      post-cat phi control 
      CLLP_ROL_trans_mode Parameter determines behavior when transitioning 
      between ROL and post-cat closed loop fuel control.

      When set to 'Legacy', transition between controllers is smooth, without 
      step changes in output.

      When set to 'Enhanced - Unidirectional', transition from ROL to post-cat 
      control accounts for ROL state re-initialization and will contain a step 
      change in output that reflects ROL state's error. Transition from post-cat 
      to ROL control will also contain a step change as ROL integrator is reset 
      to 0 upon transition.

      When set to 'Enhanced - Bidirectional', transition from ROL to post-cat 
      control is the same behavior as 'Enhanced - Unidirectional'. However, 
      transition from post-cat to ROL control will be smooth and without a step 
      change in output.

      CLLP_ROL_win_p LPG: ROL SS control window upper limit, relative to 
      post-cat target phi 
      CLLP_rst_postcat This switch determines whether or not a non-zero post-cat 
      delta-phi value remains in effect and/or intact whenever the engine enters 
      an RPM/MAP area with post-cat control disabled by specifying a 0.000 
      post-cat phi target. The default mode of operation is for the post-cat 
      delta-phi to remain in use even though it is not being updated in the 
      region. The second mode is for any existing delta-phi to be remembered, 
      but not be used while in this region. The remembered value will be 
      reinstated as soon as the engine leaves the disabled post-cat region. The 
      third mode is for any existing delta-phi to be completely reset to zero in 
      this region.

      perturb transition. 
      CLLP_TD_enable Enable the transport delay model-based CL acquisition mode. 
      If an invalid CL duty cycle is detected, this mode ramps the CL multiplier 
      until an EGO transition is detected. 
      CLLP_TD_max_n During transport delay-based CL acquisition, the maximum 
      allowed overshoot in the lean direction. 
      CLLP_TD_max_p During transport delay-based CL acquisition, the maximum 
      allowed overshoot in the rich direction. 
      CLLP_TD_mdota Disables fast closed-loop acquire mode at low mass air flow 
      rates. Setting this parameter to '0' allows fast closed-loop to remain 
      enabled under all operating conditions. 
      CLLP_TD_sw_offset Acquisition mode is triggered when the EGO fails to 
      switch within transport delay * (1 + switch delay offset)of a lean-rich or 
      rich-lean CL perturbation. Positive values slow the response for allowfor 
      more transport delay error before triggering acqusition mode.

      CLNG_postcat_winpdlt This parameter is added to "ROL window high offset" 
      and the post-cat target phi to define an upper threshold for transitioning 
      to post-cat phi control. The purpose of this adder is to provide some 
      hysteresis to the first ROL post cat window when transitioning between ROL 
      and post-cat phi control. 
      CLNG_post_fastwr_tm This is the time that the closed loop fuel control 
      will be continuous when crossing between ROL temporary (mode 2) and

      will be continuous when crossing between ROL persistent (mode 0) and

      CLNG_ROLend_tm_mode Parameter determines when the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont 
      CL time" parameter is used when changing the closed loop fuel control from 
      ROL persistent (mode 0) to post-cat temporary (mode 3). When set to 'Lean 
      Only', the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont CL time" is only used when crossing the

      CLNG_ROL_trans_mode Parameter determines behavior when transitioning 
      between ROL and post-cat closed loop fuel control.

      When set to 'Legacy', transition between controllers is smooth, without 
      step changes in output.

      When set to 'Enhanced - Unidirectional', transition from ROL to post-cat 
      control accounts for ROL state re-initialization and will contain a step 
      change in output that reflects ROL state's error. Transition from post-cat 
      to ROL control will also contain a step change as ROL integrator is reset 
      to 0 upon transition.

      When set to 'Enhanced - Bidirectional', transition from ROL to post-cat 
      control is the same behavior as 'Enhanced - Unidirectional'. However, 
      transition from post-cat to ROL control will be smooth and without a step 
      change in output.

      CLNG_rst_postcat This switch determines whether or not a non-zero post-cat 
      delta-phi value remains in effect and/or intact whenever the engine enters 
      an RPM/MAP area with post-cat control disabled by specifying a 0.000 
      post-cat phi target. The default mode of operation is for the post-cat 
      delta-phi to remain in use even though it is not being updated in the 
      region. The second mode is for any existing delta-phi to be remembered, 
      but not be used while in this region. The remembered value will be 
      reinstated as soon as the engine leaves the disabled post-cat region. The 
      third mode is for any existing delta-phi to be completely reset to zero in 
      this region.

      operation
      - "Timed out": the engine was running longer than the maximum calibrated 
      time for cold start operation
      - "Complete": CBT exceeded the "Cold start continuous phi CBT threshold", 
      and fast acquire mode will no longer be activated by cold start operation

      mode will stay engaged for at least this number of cycles. 
      CLp_fastwr_phierr CL UEGO phi error disengage; Once engaged, the phi error 
      must be below this limit in order for the mode to disengage. 
      CLp_fastwr_rich_err When a CL update is performed, if the phi error is 
      greater than this amount in the rich direction, the perturbations are

      taken when the system engages via this method is determined by the rich 
      initial step parameter below. 
      CLp_fastwr_rich_step When a CL update is performed, if the phi error is 
      greater than the amount above in the rich direction, the perturbations are

      CL_postcat_winndlt This parameter is added to "ROL window low offset" and 
      the post-cat target phi to define a lower threshold for transitioning to 
      post-cat phi control. The purpose of this adder is to provide some 
      hysteresis to the first ROL post cat window when transitioning between ROL 
      and post-cat phi control. 
      CL_postcat_winpdlt This parameter is added to "ROL window high offset" and 
      the post-cat target phi to define an upper threshold for transitioning to 
      post-cat phi control. The purpose of this adder is to provide some 
      hysteresis to the first ROL post cat window when transitioning between ROL 
      and post-cat phi control. 
      CL_post_fastwr_tm This is the time that the closed loop fuel control will 
      be continuous when crossing between ROL temporary (mode 2) and post-cat 
      persistent (mode 1). 
      CL_ROLend_fastwrtm This is the time that the closed loop fuel control will 
      be continuous when crossing between ROL persistent (mode 0) and post-cat 
      temporary (mode 3). 
      CL_ROLend_tm_mode Parameter determines when the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont CL 
      time" parameter is used when changing the closed loop fuel control from 
      ROL persistent (mode 0) to post-cat temporary (mode 3). When set to 'Lean 
      Only', the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont CL time" is only used when crossing the 
      lower limit. When set to 'Lean or Rich', the "Post-cat Temp Phi cont CL 
      time" is used when crossing either the lower or upper limit.

      CL_ROL_res_dly Gasoline: ROL control resume delay after transition from 
      post-cat phi control 
      CL_ROL_trans_mode Parameter determines behavior when transitioning between 
      ROL and post-cat closed loop fuel control.

      When set to 'Legacy', transition between controllers is smooth, without 
      step changes in output.

      When set to 'Enhanced - Unidirectional', transition from ROL to post-cat 
      control accounts for ROL state re-initialization and will contain a step 
      change in output that reflects ROL state's error. Transition from post-cat 
      to ROL control will also contain a step change as ROL integrator is reset 
      to 0 upon transition.

      When set to 'Enhanced - Bidirectional', transition from ROL to post-cat 
      control is the same behavior as 'Enhanced - Unidirectional'. However, 
      transition from post-cat to ROL control will be smooth and without a step 
      change in output.

      voltage does not go above this value within the calibrated time after

      coldstrt_ECT Cold start mode will be active if the ECT latched at engine 
      start is below this threshold. If ECT is greater than or equal to this 
      value at engine start, then cold start mode will be disabled. 
      coldstrt_max_tm Maximum time that cold start mode is allowed to be active. 
      If timer is exceeded, cold start mode will disable and return to normal 
      operation regardless of individual CBT thresholds. 
      coldstrt_mode Enable switch for cold start emissions mode that controls 
      enhanced FSO enrichment, continuous phi control on cold start, and post 
      cat control disabled on cold start. If enabled, the mode is only active 
      once per engine cycle. 
      coldstrt_state Cold start operation state. Possible indications:
      - "Disabled": cold start emissions mode is disabled in the calibration
      - "Wait for start": engine is stopped, or has been running for less than 3 
      seconds
      - "Inactive": after engine start, ECT was above the threshold for cold 
      start operation
      - "Active": after engine start, ECT was below the threshold for cold start 
      operation
      - "Timed out": the engine was running longer than the maximum calibrated 
      time for cold start operation
      - "Complete": all features met their conditions for exiting cold start 
      operation 
      controller_flash Indicates the type of flash in the target Electronic 
      Control Unit (ECU). 
      controller_type Indicates the type of the target system that will be

      cooldown_ena Parameter enables cool down before shutdown requests to be 
      processed. A cool down/shut down sequence is requested using ECI PGN 
      42351, SPN 64866. Once a request is received, the cool down sequence will 
      initiate. After completion, the engine will shut down.

      A cool down sequence is as follows:
      1). Engine speed is ramped down from the initial speed to the target 
      speed, "Cool down speed". The ramp rate is configured using "Cool down 
      speed ramp rate". The governor is selected using "Cool down governor 
mode".
      2). Once engine speed has ramped to the target, the "Cool down min time" 
      is evaluated. If the minimum time has elapsed since the start of the cool 
      down, then the cool down temperatures are evaluated, "Cool down min 
      temperature #1" and "Cool down min temperature #2". The logic for 
      determining if the temperatures are cooled down is configured using "Cool 
      down temperature logic".
      3). Once the minimum time has elapsed and the temperatures have cooled, 
      the engine will shut down.

      The "Cool down max time" is used to limit the length of a cool down. If 
      the maximum time has elapsed since the start of the cool down, the engine 
      will shut down. 
      cooldown_gov_mode Determines which governor to use during a cool down. 
      When 'Active Gov' is selected, the active governor prior to the cool down 
      will be used during the cool down. The only exception is if the active 
      governor is Max Gov, then Min Gov is used. 
      cooldown_logic Parameter determines the temperature logic for terminating 
      a cool down.

      When configured as 'OR', the cool down terminates when either "Cool down 
      temperature #1" or "Cool down temperature #2" is below its respective 
      minimum value. If one temperature is disabled or faulted, then the other 
      temperature must fall below its respective minimum value.

      When configured as 'AND', the cool down terminates when both cool down 
      temperatures are below their respective minimum values. If one temperature 
      is disabled or faulted, then the other temperature must fall below its 
      respective minimum value.

      If both temperatures are disabled or faulted, then the cool down will 
      terminate based on the minimum cool down time, "Cool down min time". 
      cooldown_rpm Target cool down speed. When cool down initiates, the engine 
      speed is ramped to this parameter's value at a specified rate, "Cool down 
      speed ramp rate". 
      cooldown_rpmdt Engine speed ramp rate when ramping from the initial speed 
      at the beginning of a cool down to the target speed, "Cool down speed". 
      cooldown_state Cool down state. 
      cooldown_temp1 The first of two cool down temperatures used to terminate a 
      cool down. If "Cool down temperature #1" is configured to 'Disabled', this 
      parameter is not used. 
      cooldown_temp1_ena Configures the temperature source for the first cool 
      down temperature. When set to 'Disabled', the "Cool down min temperature 
      #1" is not used to determine when to terminate a cool down. 
      cooldown_temp2 The second of two cool down temperatures used to terminate 
      a cool down. If "Cool down temperature #2" is configured to 'Disabled', 
      this parameter is not used. 
      cooldown_temp2_ena Configures the temperature source for the second cool 
      down temperature. When set to 'Disabled', the "Cool down min temperature 
      #2" is not used to determine when to terminate a cool down. 
      cooldown_time_max Maximum allowed cool down duration. Parameter is 
      enforced throughout the entire cool down sequence. 
      cooldown_time_min Minimum cool down duration. Parameter is only enforced 
      after the speed has ramped to the target speed, "Cool down speed". The 
      cool down time is measured from the beginning of cool down cycle and 
      includes speed ramping. Ramping may take longer than this parameter, 
      depending on the engine speed when cool down initiates, the target speed - 
      "Cool down speed", and the ramp rate - "Cool down speed ramp rate".

      COT_ena Compressor outlet temperature sensor input source 
      COT_hi_hyst Hysteresis to apply to the "COT higher than expected" COT 
      fault condition when latching the fault. For the fault condition to be 
      true, the COT must exceed the fault threshold plus this value. This does 
      not apply to fault unlatching.

      For example, if the COT threshold is set to 200 deg F and the hysteresis 
      is set to 20 deg F, the COT must exceed 220 deg F to latch the fault 
      provided the other fault conditions are also true. To unlatch the fault, 
      the COT must be 200 deg F or less.

      crank_LFP_lim_mult Multiplier used to effectively reduce the "Crank 
      limiter wind-up time" when the fuel pressure is low. Value cannot be 
      greater than 1. Only applicable when "Low fuel pressure crank limiter 
      behavior" is not set to 'Disabled'. 
      crank_LFP_mode Determines if the crank limiter wind-up and wind-down times 
      are adjusted when the fuel pressure is low. 

      When set to 'Modify wind-up time only' and the fuel pressure sensor switch 
      input indicates low fuel pressure, the "Crank limiter wind-up time" is 
      multiplied by the "Low fuel pressure crank wind-up multiplier", 
      effectively reducing the wind-up time.

      When set to 'Modify wind-up/down times' and the fuel pressure sensor 
      switch input indicates low fuel pressure, then the following occurs:
      1. The "Crank limiter wind-up time" is multiplied by the "Low fuel 
      pressure crank wind-up multiplier", effectively reducing the wind-up time.
      2. The "Crank limiter wind-down time" is multiplied by the "Low fuel 
      pressure crank wind-down multiplier", effectively increasing the wind-down 
      time.

      When set to 'Disabled', no modifications are made to wind-up and wind-down 
      times. 
      crank_LFP_open_wait If the "Low fuel pressure crank limiter pressure 
      source" is set to "Secondary fuel rail (LPG)", this value determines the 
      amount of delay after the fuel supply is turned on before the fuel 
      pressure is evaluated. 
      crank_LFP_Ptgt The low fuel pressure crank limiter target pressure. If the 
      Secondary Fuel Rail pressure is below the target, the low fuel pressure 
      crank limiter wind-up and wind-down multipliers will be active. 
      crank_LFP_Ptgt_LED Indicates fuel_type is LPG and the Secondary Fuel Rail 
      pressure is below the target so the low fuel pressure crank limiter 
      impacts to the wind-up and wind-down multipliers are active. 
      crank_LFP_Ptgt_mult If the "Low fuel pressure crank limiter pressure 
      source" is set to "Secondary fuel rail (LPG)", this value sets the 
      crank_LFP_Ptgt_mult used in the pressure evaluation:

      if FPin_I2 < ((MAP+1 bar) * crank_LFP_Ptgt_mult) then
      low fuel pressure is TRUE 
      crank_LFP_rst_mult Multiplier used to effectively increase the "Crank 
      limiter wind-down time" when the fuel pressure is low. Value cannot be 
      less than 1. Only applicable when "Low fuel pressure crank limiter 
      behavior" is set to 'Modify wind-up/down times'. 
      crank_LFP_src Selects the fuel pressure source and associated logic to 
      determine if the fuel pressure is low, and if the crank limiter wind-up 
      and wind-down times should be adjusted. 

      IODI fuel pressure switch - the "Fuel pressure sensor switch" on the 
      'Inputs' worksheet must be configured.

      Secondary fuel rail (LPG) - the FPin_I2 fuel pressure will be used when 
      the fuel type is LPG. Low fuel pressure will be calculated:

      if FPin_I2 < ((MAP+1 bar) * crank_LFP_Ptgt_mult) then
      low fuel pressure is TRUE 
      crank_lim_ena This switch engages the crank limiter function to either 
      prevent starter damage or allow auto-cranking.

      There are fundamentally two different modes of operation:

      1) Starter-Lockout Mode: This mode assumes that the starter solenoid 
      signal originates from a key-switch in the START position and passes 
      through a NORMALLY CLOSED (N/C) or NORMALLY OPEN (N/O) relay that may be 
      controlled by the ECM. In this mode, the ECM will open the starter control 
      relay to prevent over-cranking the engine according to the timer 
      parameters below. In pass-through mode, the starter will not engage unless 
      an active start signal is received.

      2) Auto-Crank Mode: This mode assumes that the starter solenoid signal 
      originates from a key-switch in the ON position and passes through a 
      NORMALLY OPEN (N/O) relay that may be closed by the ECM. The ECM can be 
      configured to crank the engine whenever switch power is on or only 
      following a "request to start" type trigger signal - which can be 
      configured using the software switch below labeled "Start signal input". 
      crank_lim_wt While the engine is cranking (or if the starter is on in 
      auto-crank mode and the “Auto-crank starter-on wind-up” option is Enabled) 
      a timer is incremented. Once this timer reaches this configured value the 
      starter will be disabled. This limits the maximum amount of time the 
      engine will be cranked in a single attempt. The wind-up limit does not 
      apply to remote start attempts. 
      crank_mag_dec_tau Low pass time constant for sensing the falling edges of 
      the crank teeth 
      crank_mag_inc_tau Low pass time constant for sensing the rising edges of 
      the crank teeth 
      crank_mag_maxpct Limits the PWM trigger level output to this percentage of 
      the adaptive trigger level measurement. Generally, 80% provides reasonably 
      robust performance. 
      crank_mag_trig_min Amplitude, multiply by 2 for peak-to-peak voltage 
      trigger. 
      crank_min_pw Enter the minimum pulse width. Pulses smaller than this will 
      be rejected and treated as noise. This value should be < 6.4us. Set this 
      parameter to zero to disable the noise cancellation feature. 
      crank_rise_trigger Crank rising trigger level 
      Crank_rpm RPM at which the controller recognizes that the engine has begun 
      turning. Any RPM less than this is considered a STOPPED engine. 
      crank_rst_mode Specifies when the crank limit timers should be reset. When 
      set to the default, "Reset at key off":
      - While the key switch is off, "Crank limiter duty-cycle" is set to 0% and 
      "Cumulative crank-time" is reset.
      - When "Starter control mode" is set to "N/O Starter-Lockout Pass-Thru", 
      the "Cumulative crank-time" is reset each time the "Start signal input" 
      toggles.

      When set to "Decay after key off":
      - While the key is off, "Crank limiter duty-cycle" unlatches normally.
      - "Cumulative crank-time" is reset only when the key is off.

      When set to "Decay from 100% after engine stop":
      - "Crank limiter duty-cycle" is momentarily set to 100% whenever the 
      engine stops, whether caused by key off, stall, or failed crank attempt.
      - "Crank limiter duty-cycle" only decays while the engine is stopped.
      - "Cumulative crank-time" is reset only when the key is off.

      The recommended setting is "Decay after key off" to prevent bypassing 
      crank limits by cycling the key switch. 
      crank_rst_wt While the starter is off, a timer is kept and once the 
      calibrated “Crank limited wind-down time” has passed the next engine start 
      attempt may be performed or, depending on configuration, the auto-crank 
      functionality may restart. This ensures a certain amount of time passes 
      in-between start attempts. The timer is reset based on the selection for 
      "Crank limiter reset mode". The wind-up limit does not apply to remote 
      start attempts. 
      crank_SD_latch This software switch controls behavior of the starter 
      control relay when the starter control mode is set to 'Auto-Crank' 
      following an engine diagnostic shutdown event.

      If this switch is set to 'Disabled', then the engine will immediately 
      begin a restart the next time an auto-crank trigger is detected.

      If the "Start signal input" is set to 'Disabled (key-on)', then the engine 
      will immediately begin a restart after the engine has stopped if the 
      key-switch power remains on.

      If this switch is set to 'Enabled', then the engine will NOT begin a 
      restart following an engine diagnostic shutdown the next time a start 
      signal is detected until key-switch power is cycled off and back on. 
      crank_skip_teeth Used on high tooth count flywheels to select the number 
      of teeth to skip. The skipped teeth will be counted and shown in CCDL, but 
      will not be used to trigger ignition or fueling. 
      crank_tooth_CAD Most recent crank tooth edge position in absolute CAD 
      crank_tooth_cnt engine tooth counter, value is between [0, 
      teeth_per_cycle] where teeth_per_cycle = 720*CAD_per_tooth_avg 
      crank_tooth_saved logical indicating whether the crank tooth stored in the 
      persistent data area is valid 
      crank_total ms total cranking time accumulator 
      crank_total_lim The maximum cumulative cranking time that may occur before 
      starting is disabled. The cumulative cranking timer is reset based on the 
      selection for "Crank limiter reset mode". 
      crank_trans_FBlim If the "Transmission in-gear override" is set to 
      'Starter Output Feedback', this is the threshold the low/high-side 
      feedback must meet for starter-lockout/auto-crank control to become 
      active. If the selected starter control output channel is a low-side 
      output, this is the lower limit. If the selected starter control output 
      channel is a high-side output, this is the upper limit. 
      crank_trans_lim When set to a value greater than 0, this setting provides 
      a mechanism to allow starting when the "Transmission in-gear override" is 
      actively preventing start. Once the signal on the "Start signal input" is 
      held active for this amount of time then the "Transmission in-gear 
      override" functionality will begin to be ignored and will continue to be 
      ignored for as long as the start signal remains active.

      When "Transmission in-gear override" is set to 'Park/Neut Switch and ETC7 
      Required', this feature can be disabled by ETC7. See "Transmission in-gear 
      override" for details. 
      crank_trans_lim_actv active/inactive indication for when starter-lockout 
      has been overridden by the "Transmission in-gear override limit" feature 
      (0=inactive, 1=active) 
      crank_trans_lim_tmr time that the start signal input has been continuously 
      active in ms 
      crank_trans_neut Disables starter engagement and auto-cranking if the 
      transmission is in-gear.

      When set to 'Park/Neut Switch and ETC7 Required', then SPN 2900 (ECI SPN 
      3086) in ETC7 (ECI PGN 65098) is required to be available and indicating 
      that cranking is enabled. If SPN is not available, in error, or indicating 
      that cranking is disabled, then start is inhibited and "Transmission 
      in-gear override limit" feature is disabled. If SPN is indicating that 
      cranking is enabled, then the "Trans/Park neutral safety switch" on the 
      Inputs worksheet determines if start is allowed.

      Note: PGN 61445 must be added to the supported PGN lists if the J1939 ETC2 
      option is selected. PGN 65098 must be added to the supported PGN lists if 
      ETC7 option is selected. 
      crank_trans_wait If the transmission in-gear override is enabled and a 
      non-zero value is entered here, the starter engagement after key-on will 
      be delayed by this amount of time. This option is mainly intended to 
      handle CAN-communicated delays for the J1939 ETC2 transmission in-gear 
      check on wake-up, though it is active and available for all transmission 
      in-gear override modes.

      CRI_FPerr_high For CRI systems, this is the high fuel pressure tolerance 
      that is added to the current fuel pressure target for fault detection. 
      CRI_FPerr_low For CRI systems, this is the low fuel pressure tolerance 
      that is subtracted from the current fuel pressure target for fault 
      detection. Note that this value is positive. 
      CRI_grneng This selects the allowed/enabled modes for green-engine fuel 
      rail air purge initiation. 'Manual trigger only' allows and requires user 
      interaction to arm the trigger for purge initiation. 'Manual or Zero-Hour 
      trigger' allows and enables manual arming or automatically arms the system 
      in a zero-hour first-start scenario for purge initiation.

      NOTE: If only green-engine air purge is required, the other 'General' rail 
      purge mode switch should be set to 'Disabled'. These 2 modes (General and 
      Green-engine) are independent and may be enabled separately or at the same 
      time. 
      CRI_grneng_mantrig Trigger to arm initiation of green engine fuel rail air 
      purge operation once the engine begins to cranking. Note that this switch 
      can also automatically arm in 'ZeroHour' mode in a zero hour first start 
      scenario. 
      CRI_grneng_state Current state of the green engine fuel rail airpurge 
      function. 
      CRI_hardware_config Common-rail injection hardware configuration. 
      CRI_hold_decay Injector hold current decay 
      CRI_hold_recharge This switch selects whether or not the boost voltage 
      capacitors are recharged during the 'hold' phase of a pulse-width. If this 
      switch is set to 'Disabled', recharging only occurs on a bank after a 
      pulse ends. If it is set to 'Enabled', recharging begins after the 
      'CRI_peakhold_decay' time following the end of the peak phase. 
      cri_Iinj_samp Sampled CRI injection current value for testing CRT/BIP 
      detection circuit 
      CRI_IMVcad_final For pulsedIMV control, this is the final CAD equivalent 
      of the pulse. Note that it may be negative due to the margin extension of 
      the base control pulse. 
      CRI_IMVcad_max In CAD-Pulse IMV control mode, this is the maximum 
      mechanical CAD control duration (which is always positive) produced by the 
      sum of the PID and feedforward control terms. Note that it excludes the 
      zero-response time offset CAD equivalent value. 
      CRI_IMVcad_min In CAD-Pulse IMV control mode, this is the minimum 
      mechanical CAD control duration (which may be negative) produced by the 
      sum of the PID and feedforward control terms. Note that it excludes the 
      zero-response time offset CAD equivalent value. 
      CRI_IMVd_fHz IMV dither frequency 
      CRI_IMVd_imag IMV dither amplitude 
      CRI_IMVff_mode This is the mode selector for the function of the IMV 
      feedforward table. It selects how the table values are used. In continuous 
      mode, the only valid values are Disabled, Amps, and mA/mg. In pulsed mode 
      the only valid values are Disabled and us/mg. 
      CRI_IMVff_TLU IMV feedforward table lookup value 
      CRI_IMVi_cmd IMV current commnd - final 
      CRI_IMVi_FB For continuous IMV mode this is the average current over 1 
      dither period. For pulsed IMV mode this is the peak current. 
      CRI_IMVi_halfpeak For pulsedIMV mode only, this is the current sample 
      taken at 1/2 the risetime to peak current at the start of the IMV pulsed 
      waveform. This is the value used for pulsedIMV overcurrent diagnostics. 
      CRI_IMVi_max The maximum allowed current command to the IMV when operated 
      in continuous mode. This limit is applied even during manual control. 
      CRI_IMVi_min The minimum allowed current command to the IMV when operated 
      in continuous mode. This is an unsigned value that should never be < 0. 
      CRI_IMVi_raw For continuous IMV mode, this is the same as the normal 
      feedback current which is the average current over 1 dither period. For 
      pulsed IMV mode, this is the non lowpass filter compensated peak current. 
      CRI_IMVpw_CAD In CAD-Pulse IMV control mode, this is the desired 
      electrical duration of the trigger pulse for the start of the mechanical 
      duration. This value may be overridden by the min/max electrical on-time 
      values. 
      CRI_IMVpw_cmd For pulsedIMV control, this is the effective IMV control 
      pulse duration in ms based the control loop and feedforward computations. 
      It DOES NOT include any additional noneffective 'CRI_IMVp_baseline' which 
      occurs after the effective IMV inlet cutoff CAD. 
      CRI_IMVpw_max For pulsed-IMV control, this is the upper-limit of allowed 
      control on-time for effective pulse durations. 
      CRI_IMVpw_min For pulsed-IMV control, this is the lower-limit of allowed 
      control on-time for effective pulse durations. NOTE - this number should 
      generally be slightly negative to accommodate errors in 
      'CRI_IMVp_baseline'. 
      CRI_IMVpw_total For pulsedIMV control, this is the total IMV control pulse 
      duration in ms. This includes both 'effective' and 'noneffective' duration 
      contributions from 'CRI_IMVpw_cmd' and 'CRI_IMVp_baseline'. 
      CRI_IMVp_acc_max IMV raill pressure accumulator maximum 
      CRI_IMVp_acc_min IMV raill pressure accumulator minimum 
      CRI_IMVp_baseline This is a IMV pressure control offset value (in amps for 
      continuous control or ms for time/CAD pulsed control) that is added to the 
      PID and feedforward values to form the total control output term. It is 
      the typical zero-response current in continuous mode, and it is the 
      mechanical response time compensation for pulsed mode. 
      CRI_IMVp_Ddz Cubic rolloff dead-zone to be applied to the diesel rail 
      pressure edot value in the derivative (Kd) PID signal chain. 
      CRI_IMVp_ff This is the final computed feedforward control term in either 
      amps (for continuous mode) or ms (for pulsed mode) based on the table 
      lookup value and the feedforward selected mode 'CRI_IMVff_mode'. 
      CRI_IMVp_FSO_Ifrz During fuel shutoff, if the diesel rail pressure edot is 
      decaying (negative) at a rate less than this negative value, the IMV 
      integrator will not wind towards greater fuel pressure reduction. This 
      value should be a negative value - positive values do not make physical 
      sense. 
      CRI_IMVp_Kd IMV rail pressure Kd gain 
      CRI_IMVp_Ki IMV rail pressure Ki gain 
      CRI_IMVp_Kp IMV rail pressure Kp gain 
      CRI_IMVp_NCvalve Selects the type of IMV (inlet metering valve) on a CRI 
      system (diesel or GDI). Normally Open allows fuel to flow at 0 current, 
      Normally Closed is shut at 0 current. 
      CRI_IMV_ena IMV output enable switch 
      CRI_IMV_HW_period This is the hardware PWM output drive frequency for the 
      IMV driver. Driver heating may be a concern above 10 KHz.
      NOTE: key-switch power must be cycled for this value to take effect. 
      CRI_IMV_Iaccum IMV rail pressure control integrator 
      CRI_IMV_Iinit This is the initialization value for the IMV rail pressure 
      control integrator when starting up or transitioning to active PID control 
      mode. Depending on the continuous or pulsed IMV mode the units are either 
      amps,ms,CAD (CTLunits). 
      CRI_IMV_mH IMV inductance L 
      CRI_IMV_ohms IMV resistance R estimate 
      CRI_IMV_ohms_Ki IMV resistance R gain 
      CRI_IMV_ohms_max IMV resistance R maximum 
      CRI_IMV_ohms_min IMV resistance R minimum 
      CRI_IMV_ohms_nom IMV resistance R nominal 
      CRI_IMV_PID IMV rail pressure control PID term 
      CRI_IMV_pulsed Specifies continuous or pulsed (engine synchronous) control 
      output strategy for the IMV (inlet metering valve) in a CRI (diesel or 
      GDI) system. 
      CRI_IMV_Vdiode IMV recirculation diode drop

      CRI_i_LS_short Injector low-side short current 
      CRI_i_peak Injector peak current 
      CRI_i_peak_BIP Peak current for BIP detection pulse 
      CRI_i_peak_init If this feature is supported on the CR injector driver, 
      this is the 'Initial' peak current trigger setpoint. This is a higher 
      instantaneous current that the injector is driven to prior to normal peak 
      current with chopping control. This current is typically higher than the 
      normal peak current and is typically used on GDI systems. 
      CRI_i_peak_init_BIP Initial peak current for BIP detection pulse 
      CRI_i_PH_offset Current trigger offset for peak-to-hold transition of the 
      CRI injector driver system.The nominal peak->hold trigger point is at the 
      middle of hold current switching waveform (i.e. average(hold, 
      hold-hysteresis)). This value shift that trigger up (+) and down (-) from 
      this nominal point. 
      CRI_i_recharge Boost recharging during hold phase. This switch selects 
      whether or not the boost voltage capacitors are recharged during the 
      'hold' phase of a pulse-width. 
      CRI_last_rise_time1 For CR injectors, this is the measured risetime from 
      injection start to the peak current target in us. 
      CRI_last_rise_time2 Common rail injector 2A peak current rise time 
      CRI_last_rise_time3 Common rail injector 1B peak current rise time 
      CRI_last_rise_time4 Common rail injector 2B peak current rise time

      CRI_offtime_min Injector minimum off-time 
      CRI_ontime_CADmax This parameter sets a maximum CAD-based pulse-width for 
      injections. This value is compared to the time-based pulse-width limit and 
      the smallest value is enforced as the current injection pulse-width time 
      limit. 
      CRI_ontime_drymax In an extended cranking dry-rail condition, this 
      parameter sets a maximum time-based pulse-width for injections. This value 
      is compared to the equivalent time for the CAD-based pulse-width limit and 
      the smallest value is enforced as the current injection pulse-width time 
      limit. 
      CRI_ontime_finalmax This is the final maximum pulsewidth time allowed for 
      injections = the smaller of the timebased and CADbased values at the 
      current engine speed. 
      CRI_ontime_max Any individual diesel injection pulse quantity above this 
      limit is forced to this limit. This limit provides hardware thermal 
      protection. 
      CRI_ontime_min Below this pulse width, any individual diesel injection 
      pulse quantity is forced to zero. 
      CRI_PCV_ena CRI fuel pressure sensor input selector switch 
      CRI_Pdry_cycwait Dry-rail mode detection is based on extended cranking 
      beyond this number of engine cycles without achieving normal minimum 
      injection pressure. Once cranking has persisted beyond this number of 
      engine cycles, the alternate dry-rail minimum injection pressures and 
      maximum injection pulse-width limits are utilized. 
      CRI_Pdry_ena Dry-rail mode detection is based on extended cranking beyond 
      a defined number of engine cycles without achieving normal minimum 
      injection pressure. Once this condition is detected, alternate dry-rail 
      minimum injection pressures and maximum injection pulse-width limits are 
      utilized. 
      CRI_Pdry_hyst In an extended cranking dry-rail condition, once the rail 
      pressure is >= CRI_Pdry_min and is considered valid for injection, the 
      pressure must drop below (CRI_Pdry_min-CRI_Pdry_hyst) in order to be 
      considered invalid. 
      CRI_Pdry_min In an extended cranking dry-rail condition, the rail pressure 
      must rise above this limit in order for injections to initiate. 
      CRI_Pdry_runhold After dry-rail mode is detected during cranking and the 
      engine achieves run speed, dry-rail mode minimum injection pressure and 
      maximum injection pulse-width values are held in force for this amount of 
      time. 
      CRI_peakhold_decay This is the time to wait beyond the peak-to-hold 
      transition before recharge is re-enabled during the hold phase if

      CRI_po1po2_margin Common Rail Injection: Post 2 - Post 1 margin 
      CRI_Prail_actual low-passed version of CRI_Prail_act_raw in bar 
      CRI_Prail_act_ediLP This is the low-pass filter constant used for the 
      actual rail pressure in the rail pressure derivative calculation chain. It 
      is in effect an 'input' filter constant used on the actual pressure. 
      CRI_Prail_act_LP This is the low-pass filter constant used for the actual 
      rail pressure. The low-passed value resulting from the use of this time 
      constant is used throughout the control algorithms and in particular in 
      the 'proportional' and 'integral' signal chains for IMV control. 
      CRI_Prail_act_raw Non lowpass filtered version of the actual measured 
      diesel rail pressure. 
      CRI_Prail_cld common-rail cold pressure target offset in bar 
      CRI_Prail_edot common-rail pressure tracking error derivative in bar/ms = 
      Kbar/sec 
      CRI_Prail_edot_LP rail pressure edot in bar/ms = Kbar/sec 
      CRI_Prail_edot_n Rail pressure edot interpolation (Pressure tracking error 
      derivative calculation linear least-squares window). More points yields a 
      quieter and more accurate derivative, but introduces more time lag. Fewer 
      points has the opposite effect. This value must be <= 20 ms. 
      CRI_Prail_ena CRI fuel rail pressure sensor input selection switch 
      CRI_Prail_hyst Once the rail pressure is >= CRI_Prail_min and is 
      considered valid for injection, the pressure must drop below 
      (CRI_Prail_min-CRI_Prail_hyst) in order to be considered invalid. 
      CRI_Prail_min The rail pressure must rise above this limit in order for 
      injections to initiate. 
      CRI_Prail_min_a This is the final instantaneous minimum rail pressure 
      threshold to allow injection including all hysteresis and normal/dryrail 
      detection influences. 
      CRI_Prail_targdz_LP This is the 2nd-stage time constant for a 2nd-order 
      low-pass filter used for computing the target rail pressure with a 
      'deadzone' smoothing effect. If the instantaneous target and the smoothed 
      target differ by less than the 'CRI_Prail_targ_dz' amount, then this 
      2nd-stage is applied - otherwise the smoothed target is set equal to the 
      2nd stage. 
      CRI_Prail_target CRI fuel rail target pressure 
      CRI_Prail_targ_dz Within this deadzone +/- band, a 2nd-order low-pass 
      filter will be applied to the rail pressure command extracted from the 
      rail pressure target table. Outside of this band, only the first stage of 
      the low-pass will be applied yielding a 1st-order filter. The 
      'CRI_Prail_targdz_LP' time constant is for the 2nd-stage, and the 
      'CRI_Prail_targ_LP' time constant is for the 1st-stage. 
      CRI_Prail_targ_LP This is the low-pass filter constant used for computing 
      the target rail pressure once the 'raw' value has been computed from the 
      calibration tables. 
      CRI_Prail_targ_raw Non lowpass filtered version of the diesel rail 
      pressure target. 
      CRI_pulseoff_force Current forced-off pulse status 
      CRI_pulseoff_hyst To keep from entering a limit-cycle when the forced 
      pulse disabling tables are used (on these tables, the active cell with the 
      most focus is used, instead of interpolation), a hysteresis is applied to 
      the x and y axis lookups. 
      For example, assume the following along the x-axis (the same behavior is 
      true along the y-axis):

      a) Fuel load increases from -14.9 mg/cyl.
      b) Fuel load then oscillates between 14.9-15.1 mg/cyl.
      c) A 2% hysteresis is specified.
      Then, once the active x-cell focus transitions from the 1 mg/cyl to the 2 
      mg/cyl block (which occurs when the load exceeds 15 mg/cyl), it will not 
      return to the 1 mg/cyl block until it has >= 50% + hysteresis, or 52% of 
      the focus.

      In terms of fuel load, after the fuel load exceeds 15 mg/cyl and the 
      active cell changes from the 1 to 2 mg/cyl entry, it must drop to 15 - 
      (2-1)/1*2% = 14.8 mg/cyl before the 1 mg/cyl entry becomes the 'active' 
      cell.

      CRI_purge This switch controls a 'General' fuel-rail air purge function 
      which is always actively monitoring fuel rail pressure during cranking and 
      can react with a purge cycle following a specified low-pressure cranking 
      validation wait. This is different than 'Green-engine' rail purge which is 
      initiated at cranking on a one-shot manually (or zero-hour) enabled basis 
      without requiring an extended low-pressure cranking situation before 
      initiation.
      NOTE: These 2 modes (General and Green-engine) are independent and can be 
      enabled separately or at the same time. 
      CRI_purge_accel_limit Reduce the purge level it this filtered crankshaft 
      acceleration limit is satisfied 
      CRI_purge_active logical indicating if rail purge mode is currently active 

      CRI_purge_cranktime Enable the purge function using crank time instead of 
      a fuel sensor 
      CRI_purge_cycwait In general (non green-engine) rail air purge mode, if 
      the rail pressure is below CRI_purge_Plower, then the rail will be 
      validated as requiring purging after the engine cranks for this number of 
      engine cycles. 
      CRI_purge_Plower If any of the rail air purge modes is enabled and the 
      rail pressure is below this (lower) level for CRI_purge_cycwait engine 
      cycles during cranking, then the rail is assumed to require purging. 
      CRI_purge_Pupper If any of the rail air purge modes is enabled, as the 
      pressure rises above this (upper) level after initiation of rail purge, 
      the purge operation is terminated and normal cranking injections are 
      allowed. 
      CRI_purge_rpm_limit Reduce the purge level if this rpm limit is satisfied 
      CRI_purge_spkdis logical indicating that spark is currently disabled 
      during purge operations 
      CRI_purge_spkpct If a time-out is specified for fuel rail purge, this 
      value sets the fraction of that time (starting from the beginning) that 
      spark will be inhibited. 0% allows normal spark throughout the purge 
      pulse, and 100% inhibits spark for the full duration of the purge pulse - 
      or until the pulse is prematurely terminated due to other factors such as 
      pressure-rise, ...

      CRI_purge_tmr This is the live ms uptimer that clocks railpurge events.

      DBW_output_Hz The H-bridge output has a lower-limit of approximately 310 
      Hz in full-bridge mode, and 1 Hz in half-bridge mode. NOTE: Frequencies 
      above 4 KHz must be approved by EControls Engineering to avoid excessive 
      H-bridge driver heating. 
      DBW_output_invert Outputs the following:
      +100% duty-cycle for a -100% position command
      -100% duty-cycle for a +100% position command

      Note that smart-bridge outputs are limited to positive values. 
      DBW_output_type Select the type of drive output. Generally, this should 
      always be set to full-bridge mode. However, if a smart throttle (or 
      similar) actuator is present, smart half-bridge mode will output a 
      commanded position as a 0-100% duty-cycle on the + leg of the H-bridge 
      output, without implementing a closed-loop position control algorithm. The 
      throttle feedback is still available, and faults will still function 
      normally. The (dumb) half-bridge mode can be used to output a 0-100% full 
      closed-loop output on the + leg of the H-bridge output.

      output drive. 
      drivebrake_min_ECT Sets the minimum ECT required to activate the Driveline 
      brake.

      NOTES: 'Retarder disabled by minimum ECT' must be set to YES for this 
      minimum ECT to be honored. The Driveline brake minimum ECT requirement may 
      be disabled by the 'Retarder run time override ECT'. 
      drivebrake_mode The driveline braking function can be enabled in one of 
      two modes:
      1) Engine-Brake or Compression-Brake mode:
      This mode turns an output on the ECM to the ON state whenever 
      throttle-open fuel shutoff is commanded.
      2) Transmission Retarder mode:
      This mode turns an output on the ECM to the ON state whenever the foot 
      pedal is detected at the idle position and the engine rpm is above the 
      normal min governor speed plus the fuel shutoff delta rpm.Typically, both 
      driveline braking functions are wired such that a switch at the dashboard 
      is in series with the ECM output so that the driver can selectively 
      disabled this function.

      ECL_chan_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). An active state for this input 
      indicates that the coolant level is normal. An inactive state indicates 
      that the coolant level is low. The Default values are:

      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd

      ecm_multi_ECT Select whether the designated input/output is attached to 
      both the master and slave ECM, or only the master ECM. For inputs attached 
      only to the master ECM, the data is shared with the slave ECM via CAN2. 
      For outputs attached only to the master ECM, the pins are still actuated 
      on the slave ECM (they are assumed to be open), however, fault conditions 
      are ignored and the corresponding faults will not set. 
      ecm_multi_MIL Select whether the designated input/output is attached to 
      both the master and slave ECM, or only the master ECM. For inputs attached 
      only to the master ECM, the data is shared with the slave ECM via CAN2. 
      For outputs attached only to the master ECM, the pins are still actuated

      ecm_multi_OILP Select whether the designated input/output is attached to 
      both the master and slave ECM, or only the master ECM. For inputs attached 
      only to the master ECM, the data is shared with the slave ECM via CAN2. 
      For outputs attached only to the master ECM, the pins are still actuated 
      on the slave ECM (they are assumed to be open), however, fault conditions 
      are ignored and the corresponding faults will not set. 
      ecm_multi_RELAY Select whether the designated input/output is attached to 
      both the master and slave ECM, or only the master ECM. For inputs attached 
      only to the master ECM, the data is shared with the slave ECM via CAN2. 
      For outputs attached only to the master ECM, the pins are still actuated 
      on the slave ECM (they are assumed to be open), however, fault conditions 
      are ignored and the corresponding faults will not set. 
      ecm_multi_RELAY_wait Select whether verification of active master/slave 
      CAN communication from the slave is required before the master activates 
      its relay. Set this to YES on the master when the master's relay and 
      wiring harness also function as the slave relay. 
      ecm_multi_spkgv If enabled, the slave ECM will perform independent spark 
      governing, based on the target engine speed and spark governing settings 
      from the master ECM. This feature requires multi-engine sync to be 
      disabled. If disabled, spark governing will not be active on the master. 
      ecm_multi_SPK_ena Enable this mode to allow arbitrary spark coil output 
      assignment to firing order based spark events. This feature is most useful 
      with uneven firing events on dual-ECM configurations.

      For example, given the following engine configuration:
      1) 8-cylinder multi-ECM configuration
      2) firing order = 1-5-7-2-6-3-4-8
      3) Master ECM connected to (block) cylinders 1-4
      4) Slave ECM connected to (block) cylinders 5-8

      Then the following coil connections should be made on the master ECM:
      Block #1 = coil 1a
      Block #2 = coil 2a
      Block #3 = coil 1b
      Block #4 = coil 2b

      and the following coil connections should be made on the slave ECM:
      Block #5 = coil 1a
      Block #7 = coil 1b
      Block #6 = coil 2a
      Block #8 = coil 2b

      The calibration would be setup as an 8-cylinder dual ECM/engine 
      configuration with a CAD slave crank offset. The manual coil connections 
      would be setup as

      Master firing order 1 - coil 1a
      Master firing order 2 - X
      Master firing order 3 - X
      Master firing order 4 - coil 2a
      Master firing order 5 - X
      Master firing order 6 - coil 1b
      Master firing order 7 - coil 2b
      Master firing order 8 - X

      Slave firing order 1 - X
      Slave firing order 2 - coil 1a
      Slave firing order 3 - coil 2a
      Slave firing order 4 - X
      Slave firing order 5 - coil 1b
      Slave firing order 6 - X
      Slave firing order 7 - X

      both the master and slave ECM, or only the master ECM. For inputs attached 
      only to the master ECM, the data is shared with the slave ECM via CAN2. 
      For outputs attached only to the master ECM, the pins are still actuated 
      on the slave ECM (they are assumed to be open), however, fault conditions 
      are ignored and the corresponding faults will not set. 
      ecm_multi_sync Selects between 1 or 2 ECMs per engine. Note this should be 
      configured as 1 ECM per engine unless bank-specific ECMs are being used on 
      a large displacement engine. The 'master' ECM is the ECM with CAN1 source 
      address of 0, and the other ECM is the slave. The master/slave designation 
      can be set by using fixed CAN addresses on both ECMs or by using the 
      master/slave hardware input select option from the 'Marine' page. The 
      following configurations should be made when using 2 ECMs per engine:
      1. DBW throttle control mode w/linear FPP-TPS translation 
      2. Max set point and boost DP modes are disabled 
      3. Multi-engine derates are enabled 
      ecm_multi_Voffset Enter the +/- CAD engine offset for the slave ECM.

      ECT Engine Coolant Temperature 
      ECTdt ECT change rate 
      ECTgd_ctl_type This switch controls the gauge driver output type 
      configured in hardware on the ECM. 'Duty-cycle PWM' mode indicates that a 
      simple low-side switch is the output, and 'Resistance Simulation' 
      indicates that the output is configured for this special type of control. 
      ECTgd_Id This is the commanded current through the gauge driver circuit. 
      ECTgd_pctref ECT gauge reference percent of scale 
      ECTgd_Ra This is the current actual resistance being generated by the 
      gauge driver circuit as measured by the internal voltage and current 
      feedback systems. 
      ECTgd_Rd This is the current target resistance for the gauge driver 
      circuit. It may include multihelm compensation relative to the tablelookup 
      value. 
      ECTgd_Rdtbl This is the target resistance extracted from the calibration 
      table. 
      ECTgd_Rpu This is the current estimate of the pullup resistance inside the 
      ECT gauge. This value may change with gauge position and/or excitation 
      voltage. 
      ECTgd_Rpu_def This is the default (initial) estimate of the ECT gauge 
      driver's estimate of the pullup resistance inside the gauge itself. This 
      value does not have be accurate - it only affects the initial gauge 
      movement after key-on. 
      ECTgd_Rpu_tau This time-constant determines the effective closed-loop 
      resistance control update rate for the 'Resistance Simulation' mode of 
      operation. It does not apply otherwise. It should generally be set to 
      approximately 100ms, but may be increase or decreased to achieve the 
      desired gauge response time and stability. 
      ECTgd_Vexc_ratio This is the internal resistor divider ratio of the gauge 
      with respect to the supply voltage and ground. If no divider ratio is 
      present internal to the gauge, set this value to 1. 
      ECTgd_Vexc_reg This is the voltage regulator level for the internal gauge 
      excitation voltage. If no regulation exists, just set this value above 
      normal operating voltage (such as 36 volts). 
      ECTgd_V_FB This is the current measured voltage at the gauge driver input 
      pin on the ECM connector. It is used in the computation of the simulated 
      sender resistance.

      ECTmon_AAT The engine cooling monitor is disabled for the current drive 
      cycle if the ambient air temperature is below this threshold at the start 
      of the drive cycle.

      Refer to "Engine Cooling System Monitor Configuration" description for the 
      list of conditions required to enable the engine cooling monitor for a 
      drive cycle. 
      ECTmon_CL_tmr Coolant temperature warm-up to closed loop activation 
      threshold timer. 
      ECTmon_CL_wait Maximum time allowed for the coolant temperature to reach 
      the closed-loop control activation threshold after engine start. 
      ECTmon_delta The engine cooling monitor is disabled for the current drive 
      cycle if the ECT is within this many degrees of the nominal operating 
      temperature at the start of the drive cycle.

      Refer to "Engine Cooling System Monitor Configuration" description for the 
      list of conditions required to enable the engine cooling monitor for a 
      drive cycle. 
      ECTmon_diag_hyst Hysteresis to apply to the 'ECT dropped below diagnostics 
      temp' ECT fault condition when latching the fault. For the fault condition 
      to be true, the ECT must exceed the fault threshold plus this value. This 
      does not apply to fault unlatching.

      For example, if the diagnostics temperature threshold is set to 150 deg F 
      and the hysteresis is set to 20 deg F, the ECT must exceed 170 deg F to 
      latch the fault provided the other fault conditions are also true. To 
      unlatch the fault, the ECT must be 150 deg F or less. 
      ECTmon_diag_tmr Coolant temperature warm-up to diagnostics enable 
      temperature threshold timer.

      start, an estimated 'ECT at re-start' value will begin ramping up at this 
      rate - but will never be allowed to exceed the actual instantaneous ECT. 
      On engine re-start without the ECM going to sleep, this re-start ECT value 
      will become the new ECT at start value.

      EGOHpost_pre_wt_mult Multiplier for calculating the post-cat EGO heater 
      wait time. This value is multiplied by the total preheat time for the 
      pre-cat sensor, which includes delay time, preheat time, and dewpoint wait 
      time. The EGO Heater Control Target Impedance/Voltage Limit Schedule 
      begins when the wait time lapses. 
      EGOHpost_run_mode This switch determines the post-cat EGO heater control 
      mode. The normal mode is 'On when engine is running' and will always allow 
      active heater control to the impedance setpoint while the engine is 
      running.

      The second mode is the same, except that the heater power is halted if 
      post-cat EGO feedback is disabled in an engine operating condition by 
      specifying a 0.000 post-cat phi target.

      The third mode replicates the first mode, but also keeps the post-cat EGO 
      heater on if the pre-cat UEGO heater is on. The 'UEGO heater stays on at 
      engine stop when key-ON' timer will also hold the post-cat EGO heater on. 
      This mode is intended for hybrid applications where the engine halts 
      temporarily with the key-on.

      EGRad_adapt_Amin The max adaptive correction for any particular entry in 
      the area adaptive table is given by 

      max(min limit, learn +/- limit * nominal area)

      Examples:
      if adaptive learn +/- limit = 50%
      and adaptive learn min limit = 0.200 in^2

      For a nominal 0.1 in^2 entry, a 0.2 in^2 correction is allowed
      For a nominal 1.0 in^2 entry, a 0.5 in^2 correction is allowed

      The CdA adaptive limits (determined by this parameter and the +/- limit 
      multiplier) are shown in the nominal valve CdA plot. 
      EGRad_adapt_dz The max adaptive correction for any particular entry in the 
      area adaptive table is given by 
      EGRad_adapt_lim The max adaptive correction for any particular entry in 
      the area adaptive table is given by 

      max(min limit, learn +/- limit * nominal area)

      Examples:
      if adaptive learn +/- limit = 50%
      and adaptive learn min limit = 0.200 in^2

      For a nominal 0.1 in^2 entry, a 0.2 in^2 correction is allowed

      The CdA adaptive limits (determined by this parameter and the +/- min area 
      limit) are shown in the nominal valve CdA plot. 
      EGRad_adapt_status EGR adaptive area status 
      EGRad_adapt_valid If the absolute value of the flow error is more than 
      this value, no further adaptive updates are performed until closed-loop 
      has been allowed to reduce the error below this amount. 
      EGRad_adapt_wait If CL or adaptive updates are disallowed for any reason 
      (other than the deadzone requirement), this wait time is imposed after CL 
      updates begin before adaptive updates resume. 
      EGRad_CdA_in2 EGR adaptive correction 
      EGRad_CLadapt_assist Parameter used to assist CL/adaptive correction 
      calibration 
      EGRad_CL_actlmt active EGR closed-loop final CL correction limit 
      EGRad_CL_Dz If the accumulated and averaged EGR% error over an engine 
      cycle is less than this amount, the CL accumulator will not be updated. 
      EGRad_CL_K This gain is applied to the average EGR% error accumulated 1 
      transport delay period, and used to update the CL EGR% command. 
      EGRad_CL_Kd Closed loop control derivative gain

      EGRad_CL_updates EGRad_CL_updates 
      EGRad_CL_valid_cnt Number of valid CL updates required before adaptive 
      updates engage. Enter '0' to disable this wait period. 
      EGRad_cmdact_err EGR command tracking error as command - actual in % 
      EGRad_cmdact_ss_dtau If a steadystate diluent error exists, the spark 
      timing is adjusted and is lowpass filtered using this (large) time 
      constant when the error is decreasing. 
      EGRad_cmdact_ss_err EGR command tracking error as command - actual in %, 
      steady-state estimate using low-pass filter on increasing error, instant 
      drop on decreasing error 
      EGRad_cmdact_ss_itau The EGR min/nom spark adjustment uses a 
      transport-delayed version of the EGR diluent command to decide the spark 
      timing, since the actual EGR feedback can be significantly delayed. If a 
      steady-state error exists, however, the spark timing should be adjusted to 
      account for the diluent error. To handle this situation, the EGR diluent 
      error is low-passed using a large time constant when the error is 
      increasing, and a smaller time constant when the error is decreasing. The 
      min/nom EGR spark command is adjusted using the low-passed error. 
      EGRad_dMAPdt_lmt Closed Loop and adaptive learn is disabled when MAPdt 
      exceeds this trigger value 
      EGRad_dmdotdt_lmt Obsoleted parameter 
      EGRad_edot_Dz Cubic rolloff dead-zone to be applied to the EGR edot value 
      used in the derivative (Kd) PID signal chain. 
      EGRad_edot_LP Post interpolation low-pass filter constant for EGR% 
      tracking error derivation calculation. 
      EGRad_edot_n EGR flow % error derivative calculation linear least-squares 
      window. More points yields a quieter and more accurate derivative, but 
      introduces more time lag. Fewer points has the opposite effect. This value 
      must be <= 25 ms and should be in 5ms intervals. 
      EGRad_EGRLP_min Obsoleted parameter 
      EGRad_EGRwrP_slew On tip-in from idle, TIP will momentarily drop below 
      remote UEGO pressure, used to measure the EGR flow rate in a low-pressure 
      EGR configuration. During this reverse flow condition, fresh air will flow 
      past the UEGO sensor, causing it to read at near 0 psi until some time 
      after forward flow is re-established. During this time when the remote 
      UEGO pressure is invalid, the measured EGR diluent percentage is pegged to 
      the transport delayed EGR command. Once forward flow is re-established and 
      the remote UEGO sensor stabilizes, the measured diluent percentage is 
      slewed back to the actual feedback window once closed loop is 
      re-activated. This parameter specifies the duration for this slew 
      operation.

      This slew time is only applied when "UEGO mounting configuration" is set 
      to 'Remote Pre-Intercooler' or 'Remote Post-Intercooler'. 
      EGRad_ena This option enables closed-loop and adaptive EGR valve area 
      updates. 
      EGRad_in2pct_max Interpolated from Max Adapt Sensitivity (in^2/100%), 
      given EGR Valve Normalized Position (%) command. 
      EGRad_in2pct_min minimum allowed EGR CdA sensitivity at the current EGR 
      valve command 
      EGRad_Kadapt This gain drives the speed of the adaptive area correction 
      updates. It is in units of % area change per area error % per second. 
      EGRad_KCL Obsoleted parameter 
      EGRad_MAF_min Adaptive updates will not occur until the MAF indicated flow 
      rate is above this limit. This option is ignored if the MAF is not the EGR 
      flow feedback source. 
      EGRad_mdot_min Adaptive updates will not occur until the commanded and 
      modeled EGR flow rates are above this limit. 
      EGRad_PRadapt_max Obsoleted parameter 
      EGRad_PRadapt_ratio ratio of PR adaptive vs. CdA adaptive: -1=OFF, 0.0=CdA 
      adaptive active, 1.0=PR adaptive active 
      EGRad_PRadapt_sw Specify the valve pressure ratio where the adaptive 
      updates should start transitioning from an area-based to a pressure 
      ratio-based approach. When the pressure ratio is between the start-end 
      limits, both CdA and PR adaptive are engaged, however, the gains are 
      limited to provide smooth transitions between the 2 adaptive modes. 
      EGRad_PRadapt_swend Specify the valve pressure ratio where the adaptive 
      updates should complete the transition from an area-based to a pressure 
      ratio-based approach. In general, this parameter should be the same as the 
      highlighted cells on the adaptive x-axes. When the pressure ratio is 
      between the start-end limits, both CdA and PR adaptive are engaged, 
      however, the gains are limited to provide smooth transitions between the 2 
      adaptive modes.

      EGRad_sens_max Obsoleted parameter 
      EGRad_sens_min Obsoleted parameter 
      EGRad_stable_wait If CL updates are disallowed for any reason (such as 
      those conditions defined by the parameters above), this wait time is 
      imposed after the condition is removed before CL and/or adaptive updates 
      resume. 
      EGRad_store_EE This switch determines whether the EGR adaptive valve area 
      learn tables are retained in battery supported memory or permanent memory. 
      In battery supported memory, the adaptive tables will be cleared if the 
      battery power is removed from the ECM. In permanent memory, a key-on reset 
      sequence must be performed to clear the tables. 
      EGRad_strt_wait Wait time following EGR flow start before any CL or 
      adaptive updates are performed. 
      EGRad_TPS_min Adaptive area updates should be disabled at low valve 
      positions since the 0%, 0 in^2 table entry will not be updated. For 
      example, if the valve flow characterization table has the following 
      entries:

      0.00% 0.000 in^2
      2.56% 0.019 in^2

      then adaptive updates should be shut down when the valve position goes 
      sufficiently below 2.56% in order to keep the adaptive entry term used to 
      adjust the 0.019 in^2 entry from updating when that cell has little of the 
      interpolated focus. 
      EGRad_tran_dMAP MAP is latched at the beginning of the CL accumulation 
      transport delay period. If MAP changes by more than this amount, the MAP 
      is re-latched following the stabilization wait period and the CL 
      accumulation period resets. 
      EGRad_tran_dmdpct The diluent command is latched at the beginning of the 
      CL accumulation transport delay period. If the command changes by more 
      than this amount, the command is re-latched following the stabilization 
      wait period and the CL accumulation period resets. 
      EGRad_UEGO_stable_wt If a reverse flow is detected in the low-pressure EGR 
      block, this wait time is imposed after the flow transitions to the forward 
      direction before closed-loop and/or adaptive updates resume. This delay 
      allows time for the remote-mounted UEGO, used to detect EGR flow rate, to 
      stabilize after the flow direction change. 

      This wait time is only applied when "UEGO mounting configuration" is set 
      to 'Remote Pre-Intercooler' or 'Remote Post-Intercooler'.

      The actual wait time enforced prior to resuming closed-loop and/or 
      adaptive updates is the larger of the "EGR CL stabilization wait" and "EGR 
      CL remote UEGO stabilization wait" values. 
      EGRclr_EFM_mdot Modeled EGR cooler eductor port mass flow for low-pressure 
      EGR systems. 
      EGRclr_EFM_mult For low-pressure EGR systems, this multiplier is applied 
      to the EGR cooler eductor port flow model output. 
      EGRdP EGR delta P w/ no offset typ across a fixed orifice or venturi or 
      across the EGR valve itself 
      EGRdP_config If an EGR delta-P sensor is enabled and the orifice location 
      on the EGRControl page is set to 'none', the delta-P sensor is assumed to 
      be across an EGR valve. Either an EGRLP or EGRHP sensor should be present 
      (but not both) and used with the delta-P sensor to determine EGR valve 
      flow. If an EGRdP sensor is enabled, neither an EGRLP or EGRHP sensor is 
      (or both are) present, and the EGR orifice location is set to 'none', an 
      invalid configuration is detected (and displayed in EDIS) and the EGRdP 
      sensor is ignored. 
      EGRdP_cyl_events Enter the number of cylinder events to use for EGRdP 
      measurement windowing. Lower values result in faster sensor response, 
      higher values minimize the engine-related pulsations. Set this value to 
      0.0 to disable cylinder event based windowing. Otherwise, this value must 
      be >= 1 if cylinder and the max window is limited to 200ms. NOTE: This 
      option requires hardware support and will is not supported on all input 
      channels. 
      EGRdP_dz This is the cutoff for the cubic deadzone on the delta-P sensor, 
      applied prior to low-pass filtering. If the difference between the 
      instantaneous dP and low-passed dP reading is below this value, the error 
      is reduced via a cubic deadzone before being applied to the low-passed dP. 

      EGRdP_Dz This is the cutoff for the cubic deadzone on the delta-P sensor, 
      applied prior to low-pass filtering. If the difference between the 
      instantaneous dP and low-passed dP reading is below this value, the error 
      is reduced via a cubic deadzone before being applied to the low-passed dP. 

      EGRdP_ena Exhaust gas recirculation delta pressure sensor input channel 
      EGRdP_HiExp_dP_min To execute the "EGRdP higher than expected" fault when 
      "EGRdP threshold source" is set to 'Table Based', the EGRdP sensor reading 
      must meet or exceed this value. 
      EGRdP_HiExp_mdot EGR flow threshold for EGRdP lower than expected fault. 
      The modeled EGR flow must be greater than this value and the EGRdP 
      pressure condition must be met for the fault to become active. 
      EGRdP_HiExp_p Minimum pressure threshold for EGRdP lower than expected 
      fault. The EGRdP pressure must be below this value and the EGR modeled 
      flow condition must be met for the fault to become active. 
      EGRdP_HiExp_source Single point or table-based selector for the "EGRdP 
      higher than expected" diagnostic EGRdp threshold. 
      EGRdP_HiExp_tbl_pct This value defines the percentage above the expected 
      EGRdP value from the "Air Mass Flow-Based Expected EGRdP" table that the 
      EGRdP sensor reading must exceed to latch the "EGRdP higher than expected" 
      fault when "EGRdP threshold source" is set to 'Table Based'. 

      For example, if this parameter is set to 25%, then the EGRdP threshold 
      used for fault processing is 125% of the expected EGRdP table value. 

      EGRdP_inst EGRdP sensor instantaneous measurement (psi) 
      EGRdP_LoExp_mdot EGR flow threshold for EGRdP higher than expected fault. 
      The modeled EGR flow must be less than this value and the EGRdP pressure 
      condition must be met for the fault to become active. 
      EGRdP_LoExp_p Maximum pressure threshold for EGRdP higher than expected 
      fault. The EGRdP pressure must be above this value and the EGR modeled 
      flow condition must be met for the fault to become active. 
      EGRdP_lo_LP_dBP Pressure margin below the barometric pressure used to 
      rationalize the EGR valve low pressure side reading for the "EGR valve dP 
      lower than expected - LP tube disconnected" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_lo_LP_dP EGR valve delta pressure threshold for the "EGR valve dP 
      lower than expected - LP tube disconnected" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_lo_LP_err Pressure difference between the target and actual EGR 
      valve delta pressures that must be exceeded to latch the "EGR valve dP 
      lower than expected - LP tube disconnected" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_lo_LP_mdot Minimum EGR flow command fault condition for the "EGR 
      valve dP lower than expected - LP tube disconnected" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_lo_rev_dP Maximum EGR valve delta pressure fault condition for the 
      "EGR valve dP lower than expected - tubes reversed" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_lo_rev_err Pressure difference between the target and actual EGR 
      valve delta pressures that must be exceeded to latch the "EGR valve dP 
      lower than expected - tubes reversed" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_lo_rev_mdot Minimum EGR flow command fault condition for the "EGR 
      valve dP lower than expected - tubes reversed" diagnostic. 
      EGRdP_max EGR delta P maximum value in the cylinder-event based ring 
      buffer window 
      EGRdP_maxv EGRdP analog input maximum voltage. Used for EGRdP high voltage 
      fault. 
      EGRdP_min EGR delta P minimum value in the cylinder-event based ring 
      buffer window 
      EGRdP_minv EGRdP analog input minimum voltage. Used for EGRdP low voltage 
      fault. 
      EGRdP_offset EGR delta P no flow offset 
      EGRdP_offset_clrdly Delay between end of key off clear cycle and start of 
      EGRdP offset sampling. Only used when EGRdP offset learn is enabled and 
      set to the Key-Off Clear Only mode. 
      EGRdP_offset_clrtime Specifies the maximum amount of time allowed for 
      EGRdP sensor offset learning at key-off. Set this value to 0 to disable 
      the time limit. 
      EGRdP_offset_dPmax This is the maximum EGR delta-P reading for no-flow 
      offset sampling. If the actual EGR delta-P reading is above this limit, 
      the sample is rejected and the offset stabilization wait must elapse 
      before offset sampling resumes. 
      EGRdP_offset_dPmin This is the minimum EGR delta-P reading for no-flow 
      offset sampling. If the actual EGR delta-P reading is below this limit, 
      the sample is rejected and the offset stabilization wait must elapse 
      before offset sampling resumes. 
      EGRdP_offset_dPpls This parameter can be used to disable EGRdP offset 
      sampling when the EGR valve is closed but pressure pulsations would case a 
      skew in the dP reading. The min/max pressures within a 50ms window are 
      compared. If the (difference / 2) is larger than this value, the sample is 
      rejected and the stabilization wait must elapse before sampling resumes. 
      EGRdP_offset_ECT Oil-filled EGR delta-P sensors may have more offset at 
      low temperatures because of the oil viscosity. Using a reasonable ECT 
      lower-limit for EGR delta-P offset sampling prevents offset mis-learning. 
      EGRdP_offset_flowwt Once all the other EGR delta-P sampling offset 
      conditions are satisfied, the system will wait this amount of time before 
      sampling begins. This wait time is ignored for the initial key-on wait 
      sequence, and is only applied when one of the other validation conditions 
      is violated. 
      EGRdP_offset_keywt EGRdP sensor offset sampling will be initialized by 
      default at key-on (i.e. the stabilization wait is bypassed in favor of 
      this key-on wait). This allows EGRdP sampling prior to engine running 
      while the dP sensor is immune to flow pulsations. 
      EGRdP_offset_learn If enabled, during no EGR flow conditions (when the 
      constraints below are satisfied), the raw EGRdP reading will be sampled 
      and used as an offset during normal EGR operation. If 'Start Inhibit Only' 
      is selected, delta-P offset sampling will only take place during the 
      key-on start inhibit period of the run cycle. If 'Key-Off Clear Only' is 
      selected, offset sampling will only occur following the key off clear 
      cycle, after a delay set by the "EGRdP offset key-off clear wait" time. 
      EGRdP_offset_state EGR delta-P sensor offset sampling state tracking 
      EGRdP_offset_strtwt If this value is non-zero, starting will be inhibited 
      to allow for a pre-start pressure offset pegging. 
      EGRdP_offset_tau This is the low-pass filter time constant used to sample 
      the EGR delta-P offset value. It should be relatively high to adequately 
      average out noise at high engine speeds, but low enough to provide offset 
      updates during normal operation. 
      EGRdP_offset_vlvmax EGR delta-P no-flow offset sampling will not begin 
      until the EGR valve command and actual positions are within this window of 
      the minimum EGR position / valve command. For example, if this value is 
      1.0% and the EGR position / valve command minimum is 5.0% (e.g. smart 
      valve), the delta-P offset sequence will begin once the commanded and 
      actual EGR valve positions are below 6.0%. 
      EGRdP_Paux_cal EGRdP sensor auxiliary pressure calibration table 
      assignment 
      EGRdP_tau This is the low-pass time constant applied to the EGR delta-P 
      low-pass/cubic deadzone filter. It is applied after the offset is added to 
      the raw delta-P sensor reading. 
      EGRdP_trust_latch_tm Time that EGRdP must remain within the dead zone 
      before it can be trusted. Minimum time is 1 second. 
      EGRdP_trust_pct EGRdP trustworthiness 
      EGRdP_trust_zero_dz Dead zone for trusting the EGRdP sensor. EGRdP will be 
      set to 0 until both EGRdP and EGRHP are trusted. Set to 0 to disable EGRdP 
      rationalization.

      EGRfb_LL_openloop This should generally be <= the smallest of the 
      feedback-based load limit calibration values. This is applied to any 
      min/nom imposed load-limit (since open-loop EGR operation is prohibited,

      EGRHPLP_cyl_events Enter the number of cylinder events to use for 
      EGRHP/EGRLP measurement windowing. Lower values result in faster sensor 
      response, higher values minimize the engine-related EGRHP/EGRLP 
      pulsations. This value must be >= 1, and the max window is limited to 
      200ms. Set this value to 0.0 to disable cylinder event based windowing. 
      EGRHPLP_Dz This parameter is used with the cubic deadzone -- the cubic 
      deadzone routine returns either a cubic deadzone limited change in 
      pressure OR the low-passed pressure (whichever is closest to the raw 
      value). 
      EGRHPLP_tau Low-pass filter time constant in ms for the windowed 
      high-speed EGRHP and EGRLP pressures. 
      EGRHP_def Default EGRHP value. This value should generally be a few psi

      Typically, only one of these sensors is available, or the delta-P is 
      calculated using 2 discrete sensors instead of a true dP sensor. Low

      high-pressure) and injection point (pre-compressor for low-pressure, 
      post-compressor for high-pressure).

      EGR_TPSdP_Dz In order to prevent EGR valve delta-P from becoming too 
      small, the throttle delta-P command can be increased to allow for more EGR 
      valve dP. 

      For HPEGR systems, the throttle dP required is equal to 

      EGR_TPS_min_dP = (TIP-EGRHP) + EGR_vlv_min_dP

      because EGRLP=TOP. Before installing the EGR_TPS_min_dP command, the 
      computed right hand side of the above expression is passed through a cubic 
      deadzone and low-pass filter. 
      EGR_TPSdP_Ktrans Enter a non-zero gain to enable additional TPS delta-P 
      requests during transients. This gain is multiplied by the transient EGR 
      command (dmdot/dt) and added into the TPS delta-P request. 
      EGR_TPSdP_limiting For HPEGR systems, the boost throttle delta-P command 
      will be modified to enforce the EGR valve delta-P limit in the 1D table to 
      the right. 

      For LPEGR systems, a separate intake restriction valve (IRV) is used to 
      enforce a minimum EGR valve delta-P. 
      EGR_TPSdP_max Maximum allowed TPS delta-P requested by the EGR system. 
      This value can also be used to prevent a boost recirculation valve from 
      opening due to an excessive EGR TPS delta-P request. 
      EGR_TPSdP_min throttle minimum requested delta-P by the EGR system in psi, 
      required to maintain EGR valve minimum delta-P

      described in the TPSdP deadzone comment above, when the requested dP is 
      decreasing.

      EGR_vent_dPPin_ph Enter the phase-shift between the dP sensor and venturi 
      pressure inlet sensor data. A phase shift correction is applied to the 
      data before the pressure pulse correction factor is computed.

      for flow estimation when the flow is in the reverse direction (typical 
      during engine pulsations). 
      EGR_vent_dPvvdt_n Enter the number of 5us samples to use in estimating 
      dP/dt for the volume between the venturi and EGR valve. This volume fill 
      is used as part of the pressure pulsation compensation algorithm. This 
      value must be <= 12, and it is generally best (due to phase-shift 
      compensation) if this is set to an odd value. 
      EGR_vent_dP_config This option specifies the type of delta-P measurement 
      used on the venturi or orifice. The default option assumes the delta-P is 
      setup to measure the inlet pressure - throat pressure. With the default 
      setup, the delta-P sensor will read a positive pressure even under flow 
      reversal. For orifice style configurations where the delta-P sensor will 
      read negative during flow reversal, select the 'orifice' option.If the 
      pressure pulsation correction factor below is set to 0.0 or delta-P 
      measurement is disabled, this setting has no affect. 
      EGR_vent_dP_loss EGR delta-P loss across venturi, after recovery is 
      complete 
      EGR_vent_dP_recov Enter the pressure recovery of the EGR venturi used for 
      flow estimation. This value should be high for an ideal venturi that is 
      appropriately sized, and fairly low for an orifice plate. 
      EGR_vent_location This option specifies the location of the EGR venturi 
      used with an EGR delta-P sensor to measure the EGR flow rate. 
      EGR_vent_MAT_pct The inlet temperature at the EGR venturi is typically 
      somewhere between the EGR cooler outlet temperature (EGRT) and the intake 
      manifold temperature (MAT). Entering 0.0% here assumes the inlet 
      temperature at the EGR valve is EGRT, 100% assumes the inlet temperature 
      at the EGR valve is MAT.

      EGR_vent_Vvv The volume post-venturi is used for a pressure pulsation 
      compensation algorithm. This should be sized to approximately the 
      post-throat to valve volume for venturis mounted before the EGR valve, and 
      venturi-to-MAP/EGRLP sensor for post-valve venturi applications. 
      EGR_vlv_0pct_dly For spring-return, brushed EGR valves only. Time that EGR 
      valve position command must remain at 0% before PWM duty cycle will be 
      forced to 0%. This is used to prevent wear of the motor due to continued 
      driving of the valve when the EGR command is 0. 
      EGR_vlv_act EGR valve delta P (actual) 
      EGR_vlv_act_dP EGR valve actual delta-P 
      EGR_vlv_cmd EGR valve command 
      EGR_vlv_cmd_dP EGR valve delta-P command. Typically, this is set to the 
      minimum requested EGR valve steady-state delta-P from the 1D lookup table. 
      However, certain transient modifications (e.g. BRV compensation) can 
      momentarily override the steady-state delta-P command. 
      EGR_vlv_ctl_lmt Obsoleted parameter 
      EGR_vlv_DC_hi Duty cycle limit for brushed EGR valves. 
      EGR_vlv_dPos_max For spring-return, brushed EGR valves only. Sets maximum 
      rate of change condition for integral limiting near 0% valve position. If 
      rate of change of the PS1 feedback voltage is less than this value, the 
      zero deadzone limit is met, and the position command is 0%, then the PID 
      integral value will be reset and the PWM duty cycle forced to 0%.

      EGR_vlv_HP_pcterr Percentage error the absolute difference between the EGR 
      model estimated flow and the actual flow must exceed to latch the "EGR 
      valve high pressure tube disconnected" diagnostic. 
      EGR_vlv_MAT_pct The inlet temperature at the EGR valve is typically 
      somewhere between the EGR cooler outlet temperature (EGRT) and the intake 
      manifold temperature (MAT). Entering 0.0% here assumes the inlet 
      temperature at the EGR valve is EGRT, 100% assumes the inlet temperature 
      at the EGR valve is MAT. 
      EGR_vlv_min_dP EGR valve minimum pressure drop 
      EGR_vlv_poserr_max "EGR valve position slow to respond" fault condition -

      the minimum allowed EGR valve's position error, value should be a negative 
      number.

      the minimum battery voltage. 
      EGR_vlv_poserr_wait "EGR valve position slow to respond" fault condition - 
      the maximum allowed duration that the EGR valve's position error can be 
      outside of the minimum/maximum limits. 
      EGR_vlv_Ppls_attn EGR valve pressure pulsation attenuation factor, 2048 = 
      use full high-speed correction 
      EGR_vlv_tau The EGR valve position feedback is low-passed using this time 
      constant and the result is used as the actual EGR valve position in the 
      EGR model. Note this parameter has no affect on closed-loop position 
      control of the EGR valve. For systems without actuator position feedback 
      (use H-bridge output channels for EGR valves with actuator position 
      feedback), the EGR valve command is filtered instead, and the result is 
      used as the actual EGR valve position in the EGR model. 
      EGR_vlv_temp_est Estimated temperature of the EGR valve. Only valid for 
      specific types of brushed motor EGR valves. 
      EGR_vlv_temp_max Maximum estimated temperature of the EGR valve allowed 
      before the EGR brushed valve temperature high fault becomes active. 
      EGR_vlv_Tin EGR valve Inlet Temperature (Tin) 
      EGR_vlv_type Only used for brushed-motor EGR valves connected to an 
      H-bridge. Selects whether the valve is a spring-return type or is driven 
      bidirectionally by the motor. 
      EGR_vlv_zero_dz For spring-return, brushed EGR valves only. Sets deadzone 
      for integral limiting near 0% valve position. If the PS1 feedback voltage 
      is within this value of the idle position, the rate of change limit is 
      met, and the position command is 0%, then the PID integral value will be 
      reset and PWM duty cycle forced to 0%. 
      EGR_Vrelay_nominal Enter a non-zero nominal operating voltage to perform 
      voltage compensation on the PWM duty-cycle output. This option is only 
      enabled for PWM ouptuts and is ignored for H-bridge outputs.

      EMWT_CWT_C This is a coefficient that can be used to temporarily bias the 
      EMWT estimate based on the current CWT (cylinder wall temperature) VE 
      correction. This is a good short-term load-history indicator, and when the 
      EMWT sensor is located near the exhaust port, it is a good thermal mass 
      influence coefficient. Typical values are on the order of 1 deg F per % VE 
      correction. Note that the units are negative since a negative VE 
      correction indicates a transition from a high load condition (high thermal 
      energy storage) - however the coefficient is entered as a POSITIVE number.

      engine_select This software switch controls how the engine behaves in a 
      multi-engine configuration. It can be software selected, or it can use a 
      hardware input channel to make the selection. All PUx and PUDx hardware 
      inputs assume a pull-up configuration with open (high) = Master, and 
      ground = Slave 1. All DIGx hardware inputs assume open = Master, ground = 
      Slave 1, and high voltage = Slave 2.

      engine_stall_manual In general, this parameter should be set to '0' to use 
      the legacy crank-cam module specific stall speed. If a non-zero value is 
      entered, this entry overrides the crank-cam module specific stall speed. 
      The stall speed is used to shut down fueling and spark during hard 
      decelerations when an instantaneous engine speed (determined between 
      adjacent teeth) exceeds this value. To override the crank-cam module 
      specific non-zero stall speed, enter a '1' in this entry to essentially 
      disable this feature.

      ESM_1pwf_RPM These parameters define the calculation of the current engine 
      power-factor for use by the ESM system. The ESM power factor is the 
      product of the current RPM and load based power factors as defined by 
      these parameters. 
      ESM_active This indicates the current activity (control) state of the ESM 
      function. 
      ESM_decel_control Enable/disable the idle-return rate limit feature of the 
      ESM system. This feature is currently only implemented for 
      idle-air-control (IAC) systems. It has no effect on drive-by-wire (DBW) 
      systems. 
      ESM_dengage_rate This is the rate at which the ESM slew-limited 
      power-factor will be slewed toward the instantaneous value in a decreasing 
      direction This is a POSITIVE (absolute value) %/sec rate. 
      ESM_dly This is the amount of time after the ESM instantaneous 
      power-factor rises over 0% that the system will wait before increasing the 
      final ESM power-factor. 
      ESM_ena Enables/disables the marine 'Emergency Shift Maneuver' (ESM) 
      management function. 
      ESM_engage_rate This is the rate at which the ESM slew-limited 
      power-factor will be slewed toward the instantaneous value in an 
      increasing direction This is a POSITIVE (absolute value) %/sec rate. 
      ESM_fast_rpmdt This is the idle-return rate-limit that will be associated 
      with a 0% power level. This is the 'fast' rate that should be >= the 100% 
      or 'slow' rate. 
      ESM_gov_auth This min governor authority limit will be used during active 
      idle-return rate-limiting. 
      ESM_idle_dload Emergency Shift Maneuver (ESM) current idle delta-load 
      ESM_idle_dload_max This is the maximum delta-load that will be applied to 
      the idle governor during active ESM. This delta scales with the current 
      power-factor proporational to the max power-factor for idle offsets. 
      ESM_idle_drpm Emergency Shift Maneuver (ESM) current idle delta-rpm 
      ESM_idle_drpm_max This is the maximum delta-rpm that will be applied to 
      the idle speed during active ESM. This delta scales with the current 
      power-factor proporational to the max power-factor for idle offsets. 
      ESM_idle_pwr_max This is the power-factor at which the maximum idle offset 
      delta-rpm and delta-load values will be reached. Below this power-factor, 
      these delta values will be scaled down proportionally. 
      ESM_Ilim_max This integrator max limit will be used by the min governor 
      during active idle-return rate-limiting. 
      ESM_Kd This is the min-governor derivative gain (Kd) that will be used 
      during idle-return control of the engine speed. 
      ESM_Kiv This is the min-governor integral-velocity gain (Kiv) that will be 
      used during idle-return control of the engine speed. 
      ESM_pwr_inst The currently computed instantaneous ESM powerfactor based on 
      the load and RPM box defined above. 
      ESM_pwr_slew The currently computed delayed and slewlimited ESM 
      powerfactor based instantaneous value above. 
      ESM_rpmdtd This is the currently calculated engine speed rate-limit for 
      the idle-return system. It is interpolated between the 0% and 100% 
      power-factor rates and subsequently engage/disengage slewed. 
      ESM_rpmdtdz This is the min-governor rpmdt cubic-deadzone will be used 
      during idle-return control of the engine speed. 
      ESM_SIS_extend This is the time that shift interrupt will be additionally 
      inhibited following reaching 0% power-factor after a > 0% power-factor 
      (and delay wait) event. Set this value to zero to cause shift-interrupt to 
      become active as soon as the power-factor decays back to zero. 
      ESM_SIS_inhibit Emergency Shift Maneuver (ESM) shift interrupt status 
      ESM_slow_rpmdt This is the idle-return rate-limit that will be associated 
      with a 100% power level. This is the 'slow' rate that should be <= the 0% 
      or 'fast' rate. 
      ESM_TPSLP This is the min-governor output (TPS command) low-pass 
      time-constant that will be used during idle-return control of the engine 
      speed. 
      ETC_loss_crank_wt If the transmission in-gear override is ETC2 sourced, a 
      valid ETC2 message indicating an acceptable gear state must be received 
      before the engine is allowed to begin cranking. Using a non-zero value 
      here will increase the ETC2 message timeout and allow the engine to 
      continue cranking if the ETC2 message is lost after cranking begins. Note: 
      This value allows the engine to continue cranking in low-battery 
      situations when the external device (e.g. a hand controller) providing the 
      in-gear indication does not have enough battery supply to remain 
      operational.

      EV_AAT The AAT value received over the CAN network from the environmental 
      sensor. 
      EV_AAT_at_fault_def A boolean indicating that the ambient air temperature 
      value currently being received from the Envirotech is equivalent to the 
      default value the Envirotech would send when the sensor is faulted. 
      EV_AAT_fault_def This setting allows changing the temperature used to 
      determine if the HC08-based Envirotech AAT sensor is faulted. By default, 
      the Envirotech will use a temperature of 76.094 degrees Fahrenheit. 
      Temporarily changing this temperature to the current ambient temperature 
      reported by the Envirotech allows testing of the diagnostic calibration in 
      lieu of actually conditioning the ambient temperature. 
      EV_AAT_mdp_avg Low-passed version of the total mass flow rate to the 
      entire engine at the ports used by the Envirotech ambient air temperature 
      invalid diagnostics when operating with the Envirotech 2 (HC08). 
      EV_AAT_mdp_dAct The current actual delta percent between the mass flow of 
      the engine and the low-passed mass flow of the engine. 
      EV_AAT_mdp_dTrg When executing the Envirotech ambient air temperature 
      diagnostic it waits until a large enough change has occurred in the mass 
      flow of the engine and then looks for an expected change in temperature 
      off of the default value. The change in mass flow is calculated as the 
      absolute value of the difference between the mdot_ports value and the 
      low-passed version of the mdot_ports value dividing by the low-passed 
      mdot_ports value. This results in a percentage value that must match or 
      exceed this calibrated delta value. 
      EV_AAT_mdp_tau Low-pass time constant used to generate the low passed 
      ambient air temperature value used by the Envirotech ambient air 
      temperature invalid diagnostic. 
      EV_AAT_mdp_trig Indicates that the Envirotech ambient air temperature 
      invalid diagnostic has seen a sufficient delta in the mass flow of the 
      engine but not a chance in the ambient air temperature away from the 
      default value. Once this boolean has been set the diagnostic will begin 
      latching the fault. 
      EV_comm_active A boolean indicating if communications with the Envirotech 
      is currently active. This will be set if messages are being received 
      within the expected receive timeout value. 
      EV_config Select the Envirotech measurement configuration. 
      EV_EGRoff_tau If the Envirotech is set to "Intake Air + EGR", it can still 
      be used to measure the intake air humidity in an EGR-off situation. After 
      the EGR has been turned off and the off-wait time has been satisfied, the 
      Envirotech humidity is filtered using this time constant and installed in 
      as the intake specific humidity. When EGR flow resumes, the intake 
      humidity is kept constant until the next EGR-off measurement update. 
      EV_EGRoff_wait If the Envirotech is set to "Intake Air + EGR", it can 
      still be used to measure the intake air humidity in an EGR-off situation. 
      After the EGR has been turned off, this is the wait time that is enforced 
      before the Envirotech reading is assumed valid for intake humidity 
      measurement. When EGR flow resumes, the intake humidity is kept constant 
      until the next EGR-off measurement update. 
      EV_RH_AAT_avg Low-passed version of the ambient air temperature value 
      received from the Envirotech. 
      EV_RH_AAT_dAct The current actual delta between the ambient air 
      temperature and the low-passed ambient air temperature. 
      EV_RH_AAT_dTrg The ambient air temp - the low-passed ambient air temp 
      delta calibration variable for the Envirotech relative humidity invalid 
      diagnostic. 
      EV_RH_AAT_tau Time constant used for the EV_RH_AAT_avg low-passed ambient 
      air temperature value. 
      EV_RH_AAT_trig A boolean indicating if conditions have been met such that 
      the Envirotech relative humidity invalid diagnostic believes the relative 
      humidity sensor to be faulted. 
      EV_RH_at_fault_def Indicates that the specific humidity value being 
      transmitted by the Envirotech is equivalent to the value that would be 
      sent if the relative humidity sensor was faulted. 
      EV_RH_at_unstable Boolean indicating that the current specific humidity 
      being received from the Envirotech qualifies as being near or at the value 
      that would indicate the relative humidity sensor is unstable. 
      EV_RH_faulted_SH The specific humidity value that is expected to be seen 
      if the Envirotech relative humidity sensor is faulted. 
      EV_RH_inv_err_margin To determine if the HC08-based Envirotech relative 
      humidity sensor is faulted the diagnostic must compare the specific 
      humidity value received from the Envirotech (RMT_SH) against the specific 
      humidity value that would be expected if the sensor was faulted. Due to 
      error stacking in calculations a margin of error must be used when 
      performing the comparison of the received value against the expected 
      value. This setting specifies the error margin to use when determining the 
      equivalence. 

      Each allowed value represents an additional bit of error in the value. The 
      smaller the error margin the more likely to miss a faulted sensor, but 
      less likely to trigger a false positive. 
      EV_RH_inv_fault_def This setting allows changing the relative humidity 
      used to determine if the HC08-based Envirotech humidity sensor is faulted. 
      By default, the Envirotech will use a relative humidity of 50%. 
      Temporarily changing this value to the back-calculated relative humidity 
      allows testing of the diagnostic calibration in lieu of actually 
      conditioning the ambient relative humidity. 
      EV_RH_max_SH The maximum allowed specific humidity value expected from the 
      Envirotech. A value higher than this setting will trigger the Envirotech 
      relative humidity invalid fault. 
      EV_RH_near_zero Boolean indicating that the current specific humidity 
      being received from the Envirotech qualifies as being near zero when 
      compared to EV_RH_near_zero_SH. 
      EV_RH_near_zero_SH The specific humidity value that is expected to be seen 
      if the Envirotech relative humidity sensor is reading new 0% RH. 
      EV_RH_rat_mode Enables relative humidity rationalization for the 
      Envirotech 2 (HC08-based). This setting must be enabled if the "Envirotech 
      relative humidity unstable" fault is enabled. Rationalization does not 
      occur if EGR is disabled or when connected to an Envirotech 3.

      When enabled, and the "RH unstable state" is "Unstable" or the unstable 
      state latch indicator is on:
      - specific humidity is set to 0;
      - the "Environmental sensor relative humidity invalid" fault is disabled; 
      and
      - UEGO drift sampling is disabled. 
      EV_RH_unstable Envirotech 2 RH unstable latch status. 
      EV_RH_unstable_SH The specific humidity value that is expected to be seen 
      if the Envirotech relative humidity sensor is reading below 0%. 
      EV_RH_uns_err_margin To determine if the HC08-based Envirotech relative 
      humidity sensor is unstable the diagnostic must compare the specific 
      humidity value received from the Envirotech (RMT_SH) against specific 
      humidity values that would be expected if the sensor was unstable. Due to 
      error stacking in calculations a margin of error must be used when 
      performing the comparison of the received value against the expected 
      value. This setting specifies the error margin to use when determining the 
      equivalence. 

      Each allowed value represents an additional bit of error in the value. The 
      smaller the error margin the more likely to miss a faulted sensor, but 
      less likely to trigger a false positive. 
      EV_RH_uns_latch_pct Latch percentage for the Envirotech 2 RH unstable 
      state. 
      EV_RH_uns_latch_tm Latch time for the Envirotech 2 RH unstable state. 
      EV_RH_uns_state State tracking variable used with the Envirotech relative 
      humidity unstable diagnostic. 
      EV_RH_uns_unlatch_tm Unlatch time for the Envirotech 2 RH unstable state. 
      EV_SH A copy of the RMT_SH value that has been adjusted to match the value 
      expected in the Envirotech. 
      EV_version If an Envirotech is communicating with the ECU, this indicates 
      the version of the Envirotech. 
      exhbrake_active Logical indicating exhaust brake is active 
      exhbrake_chan Select the output channel for the exhaust brake. 
      exhbrake_min_ECT Sets the minimum ECT required to activate the Exhaust 
      brake.

      NOTES: "Retarder disabled by minimum ECT" must be set to 'Yes' for this 
      minimum ECT to be honored. The "Exhaust brake minimum ECT" requirement may 
      be disabled by the "Retarder run time override ECT". 
      exhbrake_mode Select the operating mode for the exhaust brake. In 'foot 
      pedal at idle' mode, the output mirrors the operation of the transmission 
      brake (see the comment in the driveline brake mode above for details). In 
      remotely controlled mode, the output only activates when a negative TSC1 
      torque limit or torque control setpoint is active. The final mode will 
      activate the exhaust brake if commanded by a TSC1 negative torque command 
      OR if the foot pedal is at idle. 
      exhbrake_retard_pct Enter the retard percentage between 0-100% for the 
      exhaust brake. For example, if the retarder torque in the J1939 torque 
      estimation tables at the current engine speed is 500 N-m, and this value 
      is set to 25%, engaging the exhaust brake should provide 125 N-m of 
      braking. The remaining 375 N-m comes from the driveline brake. 
      exhbrake_source Exhaust brake remote source address 
      exhbrake_torq_max Estimated max retard (available) torque percent of 
      reference torque for the exhaust brake

      FAratio Current commanded fuel/air ratio 
      fastidle_act_st This software switch determines what state (Gnd, +V, or 
      open-circuit) is considered 'fast idle active' on the tri-state digital 
      inputs controlling this function. The states not selected are considered 
      'inactive'. 
      fastidle_ena This software switch enables and designates which digital 
      input controls an increased idle (min governor) speed. Note that the 
      Gnd/+V/Open state for these tri-state digital inputs must also be 
      specified. Note also that if a governor switch input is used, the 
      corresponding Gov1/2/3 software switches must be set to 'Disabled' since 
      this system does not actually enable a discrete speed governor - it only 
      raises the min governor target. 
      fastidle_rpm This is the target idle (min governor) speed when the fast 
      idle digital input is valid active. 
      FAstoich_a_G Actual stoichiometric fuel/air mass ratio for the fuel being

      burned in the engine. 
      FAstoich_a_P Actual stoichiometric fuel/air mass ratio for the fuel being 
      burned in the engine. 
      FAstoich_s_G Standard stoichiometric fuel/air mass ratio for the fuel used 
      in the fuel flow calibration. 
      FAstoich_s_N Standard stoichiometric fuel/air mass ratio for the fuel used 
      in the fuel flow calibration. 
      FAstoich_s_P Standard stoichiometric fuel/air mass ratio for the fuel used 
      in the fuel flow calibration. 
      faultact_AL_dis Configures which adaptive learning sub-systems are 
      disabled when a fault that is calibrated with the 'AL Disable' and/or the 
      'AL Disable key-cyc' fault switches selected is active-latched. 
      faultact_persist The fault action persist feature allows enforcement of 
      fault switch selected warnings and derates for an active fault to continue 
      once the fault becomes inactive. To persist actions for a particular 
      fault, select the "Action Persist" fault switch on the Diagnostics 
      worksheet in addition to the desired warnings and derates.

      For 'Cycle' mode, once an active fault becomes inactive, the fault switch 
      actions are persisted through the end of the current engine cycle and 
      subsequent cycles until the inactive cycle count exceeds the "Fault action 
      persist cycle mode count" parameter threshold.

      If 'Fault state mode' is selected, fault switch actions are persisted 
      until a fault is conclusively not faulted in the subsequent engine/warm 
      cycle. At minimum, fault actions are persisted until the end of the 
      current engine cycle if an active fault becomes inactive in the same 
      cycle. 

      Fault actions persisted include:
      - Turn On MIL (if “Fault action persist MIL” is enabled)
      - CL Disable
      - AL Disable
      - Power Derate 1
      - Power Derate 2
      - Low Rev Limit
      - Force Idle
      - Soft Warning
      - Hard Warning

      faultact_persist_cyc When "Fault action persist mode" is set to 'Cycle', 
      this parameter determines how many subsequent engine/warm cycles fault 
      actions are persisted after an active fault with the "Active Persist" 
      fault switch selected has gone inactive. A value of zero will only persist 
      the fault actions to the end of the current cycle.

      If the "Fault system mode" is configured as 'Euro VI' or 'CARB 1971.1', 
      the cycle counter does not start incrementing until the fault transitions 
      from the "Confirmed and active" state to the "Previously active" state, 
      which usually occurs two warm cycles after the active fault went inactive. 
      Thus, fault actions will persist as least one more cycle than configured 
      for this parameter. 

      faultact_persist_MIL If enabled and the "Turn On MIL" fault switch is 
      selected for an active fault, the MIL will continue to illuminate once the 
      fault becomes inactive for the same duration as other fault actions are 
      persisted in both cycle and fault state modes. 

      If the "Fault system mode" is configured as 'Euro VI' or 'CARB 1971.1' 
      this setting is ignored. The MIL behavior will instead be determined by 
      the applicable legislation requirements. 

      For 'Custom' and 'State Standard V (SSV)' fault system modes, the "MIL 
      start cycle minimum persistence" setting is ignored if this parameter is 
      enabled.

      FaultCylBlock_use This setting specifies whether cylinders are referred to 
      in firing order or block order for injector and spark diagnostics. A block 
      order request must be accompanied by valid firing order information for 
      each cylinder before block ordering within the system will actually be 
      used.

      When the "Fuel injection type" is configured for 'Throttle-body' injection 
      firing order will be used for injector diagnostics, regardless of this 
      setting. Additionally, on platforms configured to allow secondary 
      injection firing order is always used for the secondary set of injectors.

      delta will be implemented by cutting the fuel supply to the engine 
      fault_rev_limd Fault low rev limit speed delta 
      fault_rev_lim_latch This switch determines whether or not a fault 
      commanding a low rev limit will stay latched for the remainder of the 
      key-cycle or if it will only be in effect during an active fault condition 
      and while unlatch engine conditions are not yet fulfilled. 
      fault_SD_dis_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:

      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd

      fault_SD_dis_ena Selects the input used for fault shutdown inhibit. When 
      this input is active, it prevents any fault from being able to shut down 
      the engine. However, the "Engine overspeed" fault is excluded and this 
      fault will still shut down the engine. 
      fault_store_EE This switch determines whether faults are retained in 
      battery supported memory or permanent memory. In battery supported memory, 
      faults will be cleared if the battery power is removed from the ECM. In 
      permanent memory, a technician must use a service tool to clear faults. 
      Per legislated requirements, if the "Fault system mode" is configured as 
      'Euro VI' or 'CARB' this setting is ignored and faults will be permanently 
      retained. 
      fault_store_EEa Actual fault retention memory that may be adjusted from 
      desired based on the active fault system mode.

      the BTU value for the fuel in its 100% impure form. 
      FIMP_BTU_pure Use this for fuel impurity interpolation based on BTUs. 
      Input the BTU value for the fuel in its pure form. 
      FIMP_ena This switch controls the fuel impurity (composition) compensation 
      system. This allows the phi target, nominal EPR/MJ pressure and phi, base 
      and offset spark timing, CWT spark retard values, fuel specific gravity 
      and stoich fuel/air ratio, and fuel/rpm based load-limiting to be 
      interpolated between the base fuel cal (usually LPG) and the 100% impure 
      fuel cal (usually NG).

      If the active fuel type is not LPG or NG, fuel impurity compensation is 
      automatically disabled regardless of this parameter's setting. 
      FIMP_extV_0pct Voltage level that represents a fuel impurity of 0% 
      FIMP_extV_100pct Voltage level that represents a fuel impurity of 100% 
      FIMP_extV_input_pin External voltage fuel impurity input pin - external 
      0-5 V input source for 0-100 percent fuel impurity. 
      FIMP_extV_tau Low-pass filter time constant in ms for the external voltage 
      impurity input 
      FIMP_fault_def Default fuel impurity to use when a FTT or FTP sensor fault 
      is active. When set to a negative value and a sensor fault is active, fuel 
      impurity will be calculated based on default values for fuel tank 
      temperature and pressure. 
      FIMP_init_mode This switch controls how the fuel impurity is initialized 
      at key-on. Either the value can always be initialized to the cold power-up 
      default, or the last value at key-off can remain intact (subject to 
      battery voltage not being removed from the ECM). 
      FIMP_learn_tau Once all conditions are satisfied for LPG FTP/FTT based 
      fuel impurity adaptation updates (engine start wait, MAP/RPM window wait), 
      the fuel impurity will be updated at a rate defined by this time constant. 

      FIMP_LL_ena This switch selects the method used to determine the 
      load-limiting factor with respect to the current fuel impurity percentage. 

      - 'Disabled' option, the load-limit factor will be 1. (Thus, no impact to 
      load-limits based on fuel impurity.) 
      - 'Linear start-to-finish' option, the calculated load-limit factor will 
      use linear interpolation between the start and finish values defined 
      below. 
      - 'Nonlinear derate table' option, the calculated load-limit factor will 
      use non-linear interpolation based on the 9-point fuel impurity table on 
      the Derate page. This option has the same effect as the 'start and finish' 
      values, but this table provides more calibration points for non-linear 
      operation.
      - 'Speed-based derate tables' option, the calculated load-limit factor 
      will use linear interpolation between 'Table 2/LPG' and 'Table 3/NG' of 
      the 'Speed-Based Load Limit' tables on the Derate page. 
      FIMP_LL_pct Lower Limit of FIMP_percent 
      FIMP_LL_stop These two parameters define how the fuel/RPM based 
      load-limiting tables will be interpolated when fuel impurity mode is 
      enabled. The base fuel (usually LPG) load-limit will be used up to the 
      'start' impurity value, and the impure fuel (usually NG) load-limit will 
      be used beyond the 'finish' value with linear interpolation between the 
      two. Therefore, finish >= start, and start=0%/finish=100% defines a 
      straight linear relationship. 
      FIMP_LL_strt These two parameters define how the fuel/RPM based 
      load-limiting tables will be interpolated when fuel impurity mode is 
      enabled. The base fuel (usually LPG) load-limit will be used up to the 
      'start' impurity value, and the impure fuel (usually NG) load-limit will 
      be used beyond the 'finish' value with linear interpolation between the 
      two. Therefore, finish >= start, and start=0%/finish=100% defines a 
      straight linear relationship. 
      FIMP_MAP_max MAP adaptive learn zone requirements (max value) for 
      FIMP_pct. This is one of 4 values that define a MAP min/max and RPM 
      min/max operational window within which the LPG FTP/FTT based fuel 
      impurity adaptation mode will attempt to learn the current fuel impurity 
      level. 
      FIMP_MAP_min MAP adaptive learn zone requirements (min value) for 
      FIMP_pct. This is one of 4 values that define a MAP min/max and RPM 
      min/max operational window within which the LPG FTP/FTT based fuel 
      impurity adaptation mode will attempt to learn the current fuel impurity 
      level. 
      FIMP_pct_high Fuel leak (regulator to mixer) diagnostic: This parameter 
      represents the rate of change of the battery voltage in volts/sec. In 
      order to detect a sudden voltage drop when the starter is engaged, set 
      this value to a sufficiently large negative value. 
      FIMP_pct_init This switch controls how the fuel impurity is initialized at 
      key-on. Either the value can always be initialized to the cold power-up 
      default, or the last value at key-off can remain intact (subject to 
      battery voltage not being removed from the ECM). 
      FIMP_pct_ss Value of FIMP_percent before Low Pass Filter 
      FIMP_percent Fuel Impurity. Zero percent FI indicates computations based 
      on current base fuel maps. 100 percent FI indicates computations based on 
      indicated alternate fuel maps. 
      FIMP_RPM_max Engine speed adaptive learn zone requirements (rpm max value) 
      for FIMP_pct. This is one of 4 values that define a MAP min/max and RPM 
      min/max operational window within which the LPG FTP/FTT based fuel 
      impurity adaptation mode will attempt to learn the current fuel impurity 
      level. 
      FIMP_RPM_min Engine speed adaptive learn zone requirements (rpm min value) 
      for FIMP_pct. This is one of 4 values that define a MAP min/max and RPM 
      min/max operational window within which the LPG FTP/FTT based fuel 
      impurity adaptation mode will attempt to learn the current fuel impurity 
      level. 
      FIMP_strt_wait Before LPG FTP/FTT based fuel impurity adaptation updates 
      are allowed, the engine must be running for at least this amount of time. 
      FIMP_SW_input_cfg Tri-state fuel impurity switch configuration 
      FIMP_SW_input_pin Tri-state fuel impurity switch input pin - This switch 
      determines what hardware pin on the ECM is used to select tri-state fuel 
      impurity. 
      FIMP_type This switch controls the method that is used to determine the 
      fuel impurity level.
      - 'Constant/Default' causes the initialization value to be used.
      - 'LPG FTP/FTT Adapt' uses LPG tank pressure/temperature to estimate the 
      impurity level using the associated table.
      - 'Tri-state switch input' uses an external tri-state toggle switch to 
      indicate an impurity level of 0%, 50% or 100%
      - 'External voltage input' uses an external analog 0-5v input signal to 
      indicate an impurity level of 0-100%
      - 'Fuel BTU input' is a calibration value indicating the actual BTU value 
      of the fuel. This value is used in conjunction with the BTU pure and BTU 
      impure calibration variables to calculate a fuel impurity percentage. 
      FIMP_wndw_wait Before LPG FTP/FTT based fuel impurity adaptation updates 
      are allowed, the engine must enter the 4-point MAP/RPM window defined 
      above and remain there for at least this amount of time.

      FKNK_ena Enables or disables fuel based knock control. When enabled, the 
      target phi for the engine will be modified based on the calibration 
      parameters during a knocking (spark retarded by knock) condition. 
      FKNK_enrich_max This is the fuel modifier used at knock retard values 
      greater than or equal to the control completion retard value. This is 
      implemented as a % change in the phi target - and may be positive or 
      negative (+ enrichment, - enleanment). Fuel modifiers between the 
      initiation and completion retard values are interpolated between this 
      value and zero. 
      FKNK_enrich_mod Current knock fuel modifier 
      FKNK_enr_dec_tau When lower retard values command lower (absolute value) 
      fuel modifier values, this time constant is used to low-pass the fuel 
      modifier. 
      FKNK_enr_inc_tau When higher retard values command higher (absolute value) 
      fuel modifier values, this time constant is used to low-pass the fuel 
      modifier. 
      FKNK_ret_max The knock retard value at which fuel-based knock control will 
      reach its maximum. Knock retard values higher than this (less advanced) 
      will command the constant maximum fuel modifier. 
      FKNK_ret_start The minimum knock retard value at which fuel-based knock 
      control will begin. Knock retard values lower than this (more advanced) 
      will command a 0% fuel modifier.

      FLEV_FTP_empty Empty (0 percent) fuel tank pressure 
      FLEV_FTP_full Full (100 percent) fuel tank pressure 
      FLEV_FTstd Specify the standard fuel tank temperature used for the low 
      fuel level and gauge driver calibrations. 
      FLEV_FT_crct Enables fuel tank temperature (density) correction on fuel 
      tank pressure. The corrected FTP is used for both gauge driver output and 
      low fuel level handling. 
      FLEV_lo_active Fuel level low handling active indication if YES, otherwise 
      disabled 
      FLEV_lo_chan Select an output for a fuel level low indicator. Note that 
      this toggle switch only controls the external low fuel level indicator and 
      does not disable low fuel level handling. 
      FLEV_lo_faults If set to 'Enabled - Legacy' and gaseous fuel level is 
      actively low (FLEV_lo_active), then the following faults are inhibited 
      from updating:
      "Control underboost 1" fault
      "Control underboost 2" fault
      "Boost control slow to respond" fault
      "CL low gasoline bank 1" fault
      "CL high gasoline bank 1" fault
      "CL low gasoline bank 2" fault
      "CL high gasoline bank 2" fault
      "CL low LPG" fault
      "CL high LPG" fault
      "CL low NG" fault
      "CL high NG" fault
      "CL air/fuel ratio control at limit - too lean" fault
      "CL air/fuel ratio control at limit - too rich" fault
      "EPR / CFV regulation pressure lower than expected" fault
      "EPR secondary regulation pressure lower than expected" fault

      This parameter does not disable AL or CL. To disable AL, use Low Fuel 
      Monitoring in the DiagConfig worksheet.

      If set to 'Use Low Fuel Monitoring', then the Low Fuel Monitoring section 
      in the DiagConfig worksheet must be enabled and configured. Set "Low fuel 
      monitoring input" to 'Gaseous Fuel Level FLEV Monitoring (NG)'. Low Fuel 
      Monitoring is more configurable as it provides a variety of low-fuel input 
      sources and more fault options. 
      FLEV_lo_hyst Low fuel level hysteresis. Once low fuel level handling is 
      active, the (corrected) fuel pressure must satisfy FTP_crct > low trig + 
      low hysteresis before low fuel level handling goes inactive. 
      FLEV_lo_LLpct Load limit when low fuel level is active. Set this to 100% 
      to disable low fuel level load limiting. 
      FLEV_lo_trig Fuel level (%) when low fuel level handling should go active. 
      Set this to 0 to disable all low fuel level functionality. 
      FLEV_pct Fuel level percentage 
      FltStartMax This setting specifies the number of engine stopped-running 
      cycles before clearing a historic fault automatically. Entering a 0 here 
      causes all faults to be retained until manually cleared (automatic 
      clearing is disabled). Per legislated requirements, if the 'Fault system 
      mode' is configured as 'Euro VI' or 'CARB' this setting is ignored and a 
      value of 40 warm-up cycles will be used. 
      FltStartMaxa Number of cycles (engine or warmup) before auto-clearing 
      historic faults potentially adjusted based on active fault system mode 
      FltStartMaxPnd This setting specifies the number of engine stopped-running 
      cycles before clearing a pending fault automatically. Entering a 0 here 
      causes all faults to be retained until manually cleared (automatic 
      clearing is disabled). Per legislated requirements, if the 'Fault system 
      mode' is configured as 'Euro VI' or 'CARB' this setting is ignored and a 
      value of 0 is enforced, preventing automatic clearing. 
      FltStartMaxPnda Number of cycles (engine or warmup) before auto-clearing 
      pending faults potentially adjusted based on active fault system mode 
      fm_ac_cyc_type This setting specifies the type of cycle to be used for 
      automatic clearing of faults. When set to 'Engine cycle', each start/stop 
      cycle of the engine will be counted as a cycle. When set to 'Warm-up 
      cycle', each start/stop cycle of the engine that meets the "Warm-up Cycle 
      Configuration" requirements will be counted as a cycle.

      Per legislated requirements, if the "Fault system mode" is configured as 
      'Euro VI' or 'CARB', then this setting is ignored and warm-up cycles will 
      be used. 
      fm_ac_cyc_typea Cycle type for fault autoclearing potentially adjusted 
      based on fault system mode 
      fm_clr_mode Indicates the fault clearing mode. Possible values:

      "Normal": faults are cleared as directed by the calibrated fault operation 
      cycle type

      "Paused during remote stop": faults are not cleared or unlatched while the 
      engine is not running during a remote shutdown. This state is only used 
      when hybrid fault mode is enabled. 
      fm_cont_mil_na_cyc Operation cycles since the continuous MI was last 
      active 
      fm_cycles_wo_b1 Euro VI number of sequential operation cycles without a 
      confirmed and active B1 fault 
      fm_derate_clear This setting specifies whether or not active "Power 
      Derate" conditions may be cleared using a scan tool over the J1939 or ISO 
      15765 protocols. This controls clearing of both active "Power Derate 1" 
      and "Power Derate 2" faults as well as key-cycle latched "Power Derate 2" 
      states. 
      fm_discmil Effective Euro VI discriminatory MIL state

      fm_dist_while_MIL cumulative distance in km for the most recent MIL 
      activation. 
      fm_drive_cyc_tmr Elapsed time for the current drive cycle 
      fm_dtc_svr_ena Enables use of the optional per-fault "DTC Severity" 
      configuration within the UDS services. When disabled fault queries based 
      on the UDS severity and class information will exclude the "DTC severity 
      information" portion and only query against the "DTC Class" configuration. 

      fm_gd_cont_rt_idle Current idle time required for incrementing general 
      denominator 
      fm_gd_cum_rt_env Cumulative engine runtime in applicable environment 
      required for incrementing general denominator 
      fm_gd_cum_rt_oper Cumulative engine runtime in operation required for 
      incrementing general denominator 
      fm_gd_idle_req_env Indicates that elevation and ambient air temperature 
      requirements must be met to increment the general denominator continuous 
      idle time. 
      fm_gd_oper_AAT_max Specifies the upper ambient air temperature limit for 
      incrementing the IUPR general denominator cumulative operation time. If 
      AAT exceeds this limit, the cumulative operation time freezes on its 
      current accumulated value. 

      For compliance with HD OBD regulations, set this value to 94.7 deg F (308 
      deg K) for Euro VI applications and 100.1 deg F (311 deg K) for China VI 
      applications. This parameter is ignored for CARB 1971.1 applications. 
      fm_gd_oper_load_ena Indicates that load will be included when determining 
      engine operation for the cumulative operation time. 
      fm_gd_oper_req_env Indicates that elevation and ambient air temperature 
      requirements must be met to increment the general denominator cumulative 
      operation time. 
      fm_gd_oper_rpm_ena Indicates that RPM will be included when determining 
      engine operation for the cumulative operation time. 
      fm_gd_oper_rs_ena Indicates that roadspeed will be included when 
      determining engine operation for the cumulative operation time. 
      fm_gd_rt_oper_mode One of the requirements for incrementing the IUPR 
      general denominator is that the engine must operate for at least 3 
      seconds. The system supports determining engine operation based on road 
      speed (requires active road speed input) or RPM. The allowed methods of 
      determining engine operation depend on the desired OBD legislation.

      - For Euro VI either road speed or RPM may be used.
      - For CARB road speed should be used for gasoline engines and RPM should 
      be used for diesel engines. 
      fm_general_denom The IUPR general denominator 
      fm_hybrid_mode Enables fault behaviors for hybrid applications. When 
      enabled, the fault clearing mode will indicate “Pause during remote stop” 
      when a remote stop request is received, and will return to “Normal” when 
      the remote stop request is inactive and the engine is in a normal running 
      state.

      When the fault clearing mode is "Paused during remote stop":
      - Fault indicators are not cleared
      - Faults with “Pause During Remote Stop” checked cannot unlatch or clear
      - Inducement state is not cleared
      - CFV low fuel pressure derate pauses

      fm_induce_dn_Mon 36-hour faults cleared inducement reset timer. 
      fm_induce_ena Enables the Euro VI and China VI fault inducement system 
      counters and derates. Inducement status is reported via J1979 PID 0xF494. 
      fm_induce_l1_ll Selects the Derate Load-Limit table to use when enforcing 
      the Level 1 / low-level torque reduction inducement. 
      fm_induce_l3_km Selects the road speed limit to use when enforcing the 
      Level 3 / severe "creep mode" inducement. If a load-limit is used for 
      severe enforcement instead of a road speed limit, this value should be set 
      to value beyond the expected road speed possible during the severe 
      enforcement load-limit. 
      fm_induce_l3_ll Selects the Derate Load-Limit table to use when enforcing 
      the Level 3 / severe torque reduction inducement. 
      fm_induce_l3_ll_flt Parameter selects the derate load-limit table to use 
      when enforcing the Level 3 / severe "creep mode" inducement while the 
      roadspeed is considered faulted. One or more of the following faults must 
      be considered faulted:
      "Roadspeed short to ground" fault
      "Roadspeed open/short to power" fault
      "Roadspeed loss" fault
      "Roadspeed sensor disconnected" fault
      "J1939 roadspeed error or message receipt lost" fault 
      fm_induce_l3_ll_pre Parameter determines if Level 1 / low-level torque 
      reduction is allowed while Level 3 / severe "creep mode" inducement is 
      active. When parameter is set to 'Enabled - Before RS Limit', the 
      "Inducement Level 1 low-level" load-limit table is enforced while the 
      roadspeed is below the "Inducement Level 3 severe" roadspeed limit. Once 
      roadspeed becomes greater than the inducement roadspeed limit, then 
      low-level torque reduction ceases. Note: the "Inducement Level 3 
      load-limit from roadspeed fault" is a higher priority load-limit if 
      enabled. When parameter is set to 'Enabled - Always', then the "Inducement 
      Level 1 low-level" load-limit table is always active while Level 3 / 
      severe "creep mode" inducement is active.

      fm_mode This setting controls the overall fault system behavior so that it 
      conforms to On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) legislation. The following options 
      are available:

      - Custom – the fault system follows the legacy behavior and provides full 
      customization
      - State Standard V (SSV) – the fault system will conform to China State 
      Standard V legislation (HJ 437-2008)
      - Euro VI – the fault system will conform to Euro VI legislation (UN/ECE 
      Regulation No 49)

      fm_NOx_dep_delay Parameter configures the delay in activating the NOx 
      control system derate when a NOx control dependency fault is faulted. A 
      dependency fault is identified by the "NOx Control Dependency" fault 
      switch being set. When a dependency fault has been faulted for this 
      parameter's amount of engine run time, then the NOx derate specified by 
      "NOX Control Derate source" is activated. This parameter is only 
      applicable when the "NOx Control Derate source" is not 'Disabled'.

      The default value of 36 hours complies with China 5/Euro 5 legislation. 
      Setting the value to 0 disables the fault dependency-based derate. 
      fm_NOx_dep_run_time Engine run time that a NOx control system dependency 
      fault has been faulted. 
      fm_NOx_derate_table Parameter selects the load-limiting table used for the 
      NOx control system derate. The derate is activated if any of the following 
      are true:
      - A fault with the "NOx Control Derate" fault switch enabled is considered 
      faulted.
      - A fault with the "NOX Control Dependency" fault switch enabled has been 
      faulted for "NOx Control Dependency derate delay" engine hours.

      The vehicle must be stationary (roadspeed less than 0.5 km/hr) before 
      derate can activate. The engine speed must be at idle (rpm <= min_gov_rpm 
      + 100) before derate can deactivate. 
      fm_nox_retention This setting specifies the number of engine runtime hours 
      that NOx Control System faults will be retained. Prior to this time these 
      faults will not be erasable via scan tools or the "Start cycle for 
      auto-clearing" functionality.

      Once the configured amount of time has elapsed since the last occurrence 
      of a fault it will become clearable via scan tools or by the auto-clearing 
      functionality.

      The default value of 9600 hours complies with China 5/Euro 5 legislation. 
      Setting the value to 0 disables allowing clearing of NOx Control System 
      faults after a time period, effectively preventing them from ever being 
      cleared via a scan tool. 
      fm_operation_cycle Current operation cycle type 
      fm_oper_cyc_counter The current operation cycle for the fault system. 
      Equivalent to engine cycles for Custom, SSV, and Euro VI fault system 
      modes. CARB has the additional 'drive cycle' requirement of transitioning 
      every 4 hours of continuous engine operation. 
      fm_op_reset_key_on During an operation cycle reset, the previous cycle 
      global and per-fault status is used to finalize the results of previous 
      operation cycle. Once finalized various state is reset in preparation for 
      the next cycle. Historically, this transition has been performed at engine 
      start so that it follows the “operating sequence” definition from Euro VI 
      and China VI legislation where an operating sequence is from engine start 
      to the next engine start. For faults with “Stopped check” enabled, this 
      can result in a non-intuitive behavior where the time after key on and 
      until engine start is considered part of the previous operation cycle.

      When "Every key-on" is selected, operating cycle finalization and reset 
      for stopped check faults will instead occur at key-on rather than at first 
      engine start. Finalization and reset will still occur at all subsequent 
      engine starts during the key cycle. This has the result that the cycle for 
      stopped check faults will begin at every key-on, rather than waiting until 
      the first engine start.

      When "First key-on after engine stopped" is selected, operating cycle 
      finalization and reset for stopped check faults will occur at the first 
      key-on following a key cycle with an engine start, and will occur at all 
      subsequent engine starts during the key cycle. Additionally, the stopped 
      check switch will be ignored after battery reconnection while the key is 
      off; all faults, including stopped check faults, will remain cleared after 
      battery reconnection until the first key-on.

      This setting is not applicable to the “Key cycle” “Operation cycle type”. 
      fm_pending_cycle Specifies whether a key cycle or operation cycle is 
      required in-between incrementing the pending fault occurrence counter for 
      any diagnostics configured with a "Pending Unlatch (minutes)" column value 
      of -1 on the Diagnostics worksheet.

      When set to 'Operation cycle', the "Operation cycle type" calibration 
      parameter determines the cycle type.

      If "Fault system mode" is set to 'Euro VI' or 'CARB 1971.1', the operation 
      cycle type is used for pending fault occurrence counter handling, 
      regardless of the value set for this parameter.

      fm_wuc_wo_MIL number of warm-up cycles without MIL. Used to count up to 40 
      consecutive warm-up cycles for clearing of fm_rt_while_MIL and 
      fm_dist_while_MIL. This is an internal tracking item and not an item 
      reported over ISO 15765. 
      fm_wus_ect_delta The amount the ECT must rise from the temperature at 
      engine start to consider a drive cycle "warmed up". This value will be 
      specified in the target legislature/compliance level. Typically the value 
      is 40 deg F (22 K/22 deg C). 
      fm_wus_ect_min The minimum temperature the ECT must meet to consider a 
      drive cycle as "warmed up". This value will be specified in the target 
      legislature/compliance level. Typically the value is 160 deg F (343 K/70 
      deg C) for gasoline and 140 deg F (333 K/60 deg C) for diesel.

      FOP_detect_time Parameter is only applicable when "Fuel pressure high 
      during start" fault is enabled and "Active fuel device" is 'Carb - MJ / 
      EPR'. When fault's entry conditions are valid, preemptive actions are 
      taken before fault latches. If the fault's entry conditions are valid for 
      this parameter's length of time, then the fuel lockoff(s) are closed and 
      spark is inhibited. The inhibition will cease once fuel pressure has 
      dropped below the entry condition's threshold for this parameter's length 
      of time. Parameter cannot be greater than 100 ms. 
      FOP_inhibit_active Indicates if fuel over pressure (FOP) during start 
      feature is inhibiting the lockoff(s) from opening and inhibiting spark.

      this number. In effect, this value scales all gains up or down relative to 
      a final output voltage. This value must have enough +/- authority to 
      properly override the feedforward voltage schedule.

      error must stay below the "Derate dis-engage pressure error maximum" 
      threshold to deactivate low fuel pressure derate after engagement. 
      FPlo_derate_dly_on This value specifies the amount of time the pressure 
      error must persist at or above the "Derate engage pressure error minimum" 
      threshold to activate low fuel pressure derate. 
      FPlo_derate_ena If enabled, a low fuel pressure derate load-limit is 
      automatically calculated and applied if the pressure error reaches the 
      threshold specified in the "Derate engage pressure error minimum" 
      parameter. Once the derate is active, it will dis-engage when the pressure 
      error falls below the "Derate dis-engage pressure error maximum" 
threshold.

      This feature is supported for gaseous fuel applications utilizing the CFV 
      or Secondary Pulse Injection for fuel admission.

      specifies the minimum run time before enabling the low fuel pressure

      low-pass filter that is applied to the calculated load-limit after low 
      fuel pressure derate dis-engages. 
      FPlo_derate_on_tau This value specifies the time constant used for the 
      low-pass filter that is applied to the calculated load-limit after low 
      fuel pressure derate engages. 
      FPlo_derate_Poff To deactivate low fuel pressure derate after engagement, 
      the pressure error must fall below this threshold. If "Derate dis-engage 
      delay" is non-zero, then the pressure error must persist below this 
      threshold for the specified number of seconds before the derate is 
      dis-engaged. 
      FPlo_derate_Pon This value specifies the minimum pressure error that will 
      activate low fuel pressure derate. If "Derate engage delay" is non-zero, 
      then the pressure error must persist at or above this threshold for the 
      specified number of seconds before the derate is engaged. 
      FPlo_derate_Ptau This value specifies the time constant used for the 
      low-pass filter that is applied to the pressure error prior to determining 
      if the error has reached the "Derate engage pressure error minimum" 
      threshold for low fuel pressure derate activation or fallen below the 
      "Derate dis-engage pressure error maximum" threshold for derate 
      deactivation. 
      FPlo_derate_Ptgt If the active fuel device is Secondary Pulse Injection 
      and the low fuel pressure is then based on Secondary fuel rail pressure 
      target, this is the final computed target fuel pressure for the low fuel 
      pressure determination and derate. The low fuel pressure target is 
      computed:

      Secondary_fuel_rail_P_target * multiplier 
      FPlo_derate_P_hi If this value is > 0, and the pressure error is >= this 
      value, then the "Derate active pressure error high load-limit" is 
      activated. The "Derate active pressure error high load-limit" is a severe 
      load-limit and can be lower than the "Derate load-limit minimum". 
      FPlo_derate_P_hi_LL If the pressure error is >= "Derate active pressure 
      error high", then this value is activated for the load-limit. This value 
      is intended to be a severe or idle load-limit and can be lower than the 
      "Derate load-limit minimum".

      FPP1_5V_source This switch selects which 5V excitation source the FPP1 pot 
      is powered from. This is important since the health and trustworthiness of 
      this pot is dependent on the health of its power source. The 'rescaled' 
      version of the secondary source should be used if the secondary 5V source 
      is a high-impedance output and proper 'ratiometric' voltages are to be 
      used. 
      FPP1_center FPP1 default midpoint 
      FPP1_def default FPP1 voltage 
      FPP1_full Voltage at full open - FPP1 
      FPP1_full_init Initial value (just after key-on) for FPP1_full voltage. 
      FPP1_full will be learned upward if a higher voltage is detected at any 
      time during the key-on cycle. See comments for 'FPP1 learn wait' below for 
      a further description of this learning procedure.

      Note: For a negative-slope FPP1, the learning will be downward for 
      FPP1_full.

      Note: For a marine throttle & gear handle configuration, this value 
      specifies the full-forward voltage level. Learning should be disabled in 
      this scenario by setting the FPP1 learn wait parameter to 32767 ms. Also 
      note that the average of this voltage and the 'FPP1 idle init' voltage 
      will determine the center neutral point expected voltage. This center 
      voltage is usually the critical tolerance, so 'FPP1 idle init' and 'FPP1 
      full init' precision should be sacrificed to properly specify an accurate 
      center voltage. 
      FPP1_idle Voltage at idle - FPP1 
      FPP1_idle_init Initial value (just after key-on) for FPP1_idle voltage. 
      FPP1_idle will be learned downward if a lower voltage is detected at any 
      time during the key-on cycle. See comments for 'FPP1 learn wait' below for 
      a further description of this learning procedure.

      Note: For a negative-slope FPP1, the learning will be upward for 
FPP1_idle.

      Note: For a marine throttle & gear handle configuration, this value 
      specifies the full-reverse voltage level. Learning should be disabled in 
      this scenario by setting the FPP1 learn wait parameter to 32767 ms. Also 
      note that the average of this voltage and the 'FPP1 full init' voltage 
      will determine the enter neutral point expected voltage. This center 
      voltage is usually the critical tolerance, so 'FPP1 idle init' and 'FPP1 
      full init' precision should be sacrificed to properly specify an accurate 
      center voltage. 
      FPP1_IVS_max FPP1 higher than IVS limit diagnostic: Entry condition - If 
      IVS is at-idle when FPP1 is greater than this value, the fault is 
      triggered. 
      FPP1_IVS_min FPP1 lower than IVS limit diagnostic: Entry condition - If 
      IVS is off-idle when FPP1 is lower than this value, the fault is 
      triggered. 
      FPP1_kickdown_on_V When enabled, in addition to exceeding the “FPP 
      kickdown engagement” % limit, the FFP1 voltage (FPP1_rawfilt) must also 
      exceed this limit to engage active-kickdown in the J1939 EEC2 message.

      Setting this value to 0 will disable use of this limit.

      Use of this setting requires FPP1 learn to be disabled by setting “FPP1 
      learn wait” (FPP1_learn_wait) to 32767. 
      FPP1_learn_tau Whenever a voltage lower than the current minimum idle 
      voltage or greater than the current full voltage is detected, a new idle 
      or full voltage will be 'learned' using this low-pass time constant, once 
      the "FPP1 learn wait" period has elapsed. 
      FPP1_learn_wait Whenever a voltage lower than the current minimum idle 
      voltage or greater than the current full voltage is detected, this fixed 
      amount of time must expire before any 'learning' of this lower idle or 
      higher full position voltage is allowed.

      FPP1_PWM_edge FPP1 PWM edge capture mode. 
      FPP1_PWM_ena Selects the pulse input for the TSC1 redundant foot pedal. 
      When enabled:
      1. The PWM frequency is scaled to a voltage using the FPP1 calibration. 
      The “FPP1 high voltage” or “FPP1 low voltage” faults indicate out-of-range 
      frequencies or loss of signal.
      2. EEC2 SPN 91 is scaled to a voltage using the FPP2 calibration. 
      Depending on the voltage configuration, the “FPP2 high voltage” or “FPP2 
      low voltage” fault indicates EEC2 reception loss.
      3. The resulting FPP1 and FPP2 voltages are rationalized as a dual-pot 
      foot pedal without IVS. The “FPP1 higher than FPP2” and “FPP1 lower than 
      FPP2” faults indicate when the PWM-indicated position is valid.
      4. While TSC1 reception is lost and the "J1939 TSC1 message receipt lost" 
      fault is latched, the resulting PWM foot pedal position is used.
      5. If EEC2 reception is also lost, and the “FPP1 higher/lower than FPP2” 
      faults are not latched, then the PWM foot pedal position will continue to 
      be used. However, because of the lack of redundancy, the Force Idle derate 
      will temporarily be active while the foot pedal position appears to be 
      stuck based on the “Stuck Foot Pedal Detection” calibration. 
      FPP1_PWM_Hz FPP1 PWM foot pedal frequency. 
      FPP1_PWM_Hz_full PWM frequency indicating the TSC1 redundant foot pedal 
      fully-depressed position. Valid range is 1.193 Hz to 20 MHz. 
      FPP1_PWM_Hz_idle PWM frequency indicating the TSC1 redundant foot pedal 
      idle position. Valid range is 1.193 Hz to 20 MHz. 
      FPP1_PWM_idle_rpm Minimum idle speed when conditions are valid to use the 
      TSC1 redundant foot pedal. 
      FPP1_raw FPP1 raw voltage 
      FPP1_rawfilt FPP1 raw (LPF) voltage 
      FPP1_switch_ena This option is only valid if the "Primary foot pedal mode" 
      is set to 'Throttle Control' or 'Speed Control'. If a valid signal (e.g. 
      +V) is detected on the hardware pin selected, the actual FPP mode will 
      toggle from 'Throttle Control' to 'Speed Control', or 'Speed Control' to 
      'Throttle Control'. 
      FPP1_trust Trust indicator for FPP1 input (-1 = no trust, 0/1=OK but 
      proportionally less than ideal, 2=100% trustworthy) 
      FPP2atidle_ena FPP2 lower than IVS limit diagnostic: This switch enables 
      the 'FPP @idle' diagnostic which is designed to diagnose IVS switchpoint 
      disagreements on foot pedals with IVS switch points very close to the 
      minimum pedal position (no pedal depression).

      learned idle delta 
      FPP2atidle_IVSmargin FPP2 @idle margin to IVS off-idle. When the 'FPP2 
      @idle' diagnostic is turned on, this amount of delta-voltage from the 
      learned idle position must be observed without the IVS switching to an 
      off-idle condition during an increase in FPP2 position. 
      FPP2atidle_max FPP2 @idle normal max. When the 'FPP2 @idle' diagnostic is 
      turned on, this parameter informs the pedal monitoring system of the 
      normal maximum possible voltage of the FPP2 pot in an idle condition (no 
      pedal depression). 
      FPP2atidle_min When the 'FPP2 @idle' diagnostic is turned on by setting 
      the FPP2 @idle switch on the diagnostic page to 'Enabled', this parameter 
      informs the pedal monitoring system of the normal minimum possible voltage 
      of the FPP2 pot in an idle condition (no pedal depression).

      Note: For a negative-slope FPP2, this is the normal maximum possible 
      voltage of the FPP2 pot in an idle condition.

      Note: This is normally an absolute voltage value to be compared against 
      FPP2. The one exception is when the "Marine throttle & gear handle FPP 
      mode" option is enabled on the 'Marine' page. In this scenario, this value 
      has no meaning since the center position voltage is idle. Only the "FPP2 
      @idle normal max" has meaning.

      FPP2_learn_tau Whenever a voltage lower than the current minimum idle 
      voltage or greater than the current full voltage is detected, a new idle 
      or full voltage will be 'learned' using this low-pass time constant, once

      FPP2_mode This switch selects what the FPP2 input is used for when the 
      'second foot pedal' option is engaged:
      1) disabled
      2) to determine throttle position
      3) to determine engine speed setpoint

      condition during an increase in FPP position. 
      FPPatidle_max When the 'FPP1 @idle' diagnostic is turned on by setting the 
      FPP1 @idle switch on the diagnostic page to 'Enabled', this parameter 
      informs the pedal monitoring system of the normal maximum possible voltage 
      of the FPP1 pot in an idle condition (no pedal depression).

      Note: For a negative-slope FPP1, this is the normal minimum possible 
      voltage of the FPP1 pot in an idle condition.

      Note: This is normally an absolute voltage value to be compared against 
      FPP1. The one exception is when the "Marine throttle & gear handle FPP 
      mode" option is enabled on the 'Marine' page. In this scenario, this is 
      interpreted as a delta-voltage from the center position voltage in either

      of the FPP1 pot in an idle condition (no pedal depression).

      Note: For a negative-slope FPP1, this is the normal maximum possible 
      voltage of the FPP1 pot in an idle condition.

      Note: This is normally an absolute voltage value to be compared against 
      FPP1. The one exception is when the "Marine throttle & gear handle FPP 
      mode" option is enabled on the 'Marine' page. In this scenario, this value 
      has no meaning since the center position voltage is idle. Only the "FPP1 
      @idle normal max" value below has meaning.

      FPPdualpot_ena This enables use of a dual pot (redundant pot) foot pedal. 
      FPPdual_pedal This option enables 2 independent FPP inputs (as opposed to 
      a redundant FPP1/2 potentiometer setup).

      For the 'Enabled BRAKE=FPP2' option, selection between these two 
      independent inputs is accomplished through the BRAKE digital input:
      BRAKE invalid = FPP1
      BRAKE valid = FPP2

      For the 'Enabled BRAKE=FPP max' option, when the BRAKE digital input is 
      valid, the greater of FPP1 and FPP2 is used:
      BRAKE invalid = FPP1
      BRAKE valid = max(FPP1, FPP2)
      Note this option requires FPP1 mode and FPP2 mode be set equal in the 
      calibration or unexpected behavior may result (e.g. do not set FPP1 for 
      throttle control and FPP2 for speed control when using this mode).

      For the 'Enabled input=FPP2' option, selection between these two 
      independent inputs is accomplished through the 'Second foot pedal input'. 
      If the input is true, FPP2 is used. 
      FPPdual_pedal_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG9 = Gnd
      Aux DIG10 = Gnd
      Aux DIG11 = Gnd
      Aux DIG12 = Gnd
      Aux DIG13 = Gnd
      Aux DIG14 = Gnd
      Aux DIG15 = Gnd
      Aux DIG16 = Gnd
      Aux DIG17 = Gnd
      Aux DIG18 = Gnd
      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      FPPdual_pedal_chan This input toggle can be used to switch between 
      independent FPP1 and FPP2. The 'Second foot pedal control' must be set to 
      'Enabled input=FPP2'. This input toggle is used primarily on vehicles that 
      have a second independent foot pedal for engine operation during 
      maintenance. 
      FPPgear_command marine gear handle final commanded gear (-1=reverse, 
      0=neutral, 1=forward) - note that this selection may be gear-lockout 
      overridden 
      FPPgear_gear_dz This is the % movement from the vertical neutral position 
      on the handle to the point in forward/backward motion that a shift to 
      forward/reverse should occur. For interpretation of the % unit, 
      100%=center neutral to full-forward angular movement. 
      FPPgear_handle This switch indicates to FPP and shift handling software 
      that a marine handle is being used for both throttle and transmission 
      control based on handle position. Neutral is assumed to be at the 50% 
      center point of the FPP range, > 50% movement indicates forward gear 
      selection, and < 50% movement indicates reverse gear selection. Actual 
      shift and throttle points are defined by the deadzones. 
      FPPgear_indicate marine gear handle initial indicated gear (-1=reverse, 
      0=neutral, 1=forward) 
      FPPgear_ntrlk_t This is the live uptimer that must exceed 
      FPPgearl_ntrlk_tout before a neutral interlock will be released. 
      FPPgear_ntrlk_tout For a marine gear handle at key-on and following any 
      FPP fault forcing a return to neutral, gear selection will be locked out 
      for this amount of time until the FPP is valid and the user has selected 
      neutral (typically 50-200ms). 
      FPPgear_throt_Fdz This is the % movement from the vertical neutral 
      position on the handle to the point in forward motion that the FPP command 
      will begin to rise above zero. For interpretation of the % unit, 
      100%=center neutral to full-forward angular movement. This deadzone should 
      typically be larger than the shift deadzone above so that the shift can be 
      accomplished prior to engine speed increases. 
      FPPgear_throt_Rdz This is the % movement from the vertical neutral 
      position on the handle to the point in rearward (reverse) motion that the 
      FPP command will begin to rise above zero. For interpretation of the % 
      unit, 100%=center neutral to full-reverse angular movement. This deadzone 
      should typically be larger than the shift deadzone above so that the shift 
      can be accomplished prior to engine speed increases. 
      FPPIVS_ena This enables use of an idle-validation switch (IVS) on the 
      primary foot pedal input. The two non-network enabled modes select the 
      configuration of the IVS switch in the idle (and off-idle) conditions. If 
      the 'second foot pedal' option is selected, the IVS is only analyzed for 
      the FPP1 input. In 'Enabled - Network' mode, the IVS input source is 
      ignored since the IVS off-idle/at-idle indication is received via CAN.

      FPPslewdown_ena This switch controls whether or not the table below is 
      used to slew-rate limit decreasing FPP commands.

      If enabled, the current (i.e. slew-rate limited FPP) is used along with 
      the TIP to index into the table below to extract a slew rate limit for the 
      FPP command. In general, this table can be used to minimize turbo surge by 
      limiting the decreasing FPP slew rate at high TIP and low current FPP 
      levels.

      FPP_dz_pct Enter the FPP deadzone. If , the deadzone is ignored and the 
      raw FPP voltage input is filtered using the LP fast filter time constant 
      from the 'Miscellaneous' tab. If a non-zero value is entered, the filtered 
      FPP input is passed through an additional low-pass filter (specified by 
      the FPP deadzone tau below). When the difference between the heavily 
      filtered and normally filtered FPP values exceeds this deadzone, the FPP 
      command is equal to the normally filtered FPP value. When the difference 
      is below this deadzone, the difference is cubed and added to the heavily 
      filtered FPP value to form the final FPP command.The maximum allowed value 
      for deadzone is 49.99% 
      FPP_dz_tau FPP deadzone time constant used in LPF 
      FPP_EOL_throt force engine into FPP mode into throttle control if in a 
      speed control mode 
      FPP_full_valid If FPP >= FPP_full-FPP_WOT_dedbnd, the FPP is at a WOT 
      condition of 100%. If FPP < FPP_full-FPP_WOT_dedbnd, the FPP is at less 
      than 100%. Use this value to install a WOT dead-band at the end of the FPP 
      travel - such as for a transmission kick-down switch. 
      FPP_idle_valid If FPP <= FPP_idle+FPP_idle_delta, an idle condition 
      (minimum FPP) is validated. If FPP > FPP_idle+FPP_idle_delta the FPP is 
      considered off-idle. This is the default value for FPP_idle, and may be 
      overridden by certain vehicle/transmission configurations. 
      FPP_idlvld_cur Currently active FPP idle deadzone. 
      FPP_kickdown_active FPP exceeded the kickdown engage threshold percentage 
      and has NOT decreased below the disengage setpoint 
      FPP_kickdown_ena Switch to engage FPP kickdown monitoring 
      FPP_kickdown_off FPP percentages above the engagement limit will be 
      flagged as active-kickdown in the J1939 EEC2 message. The FPP must drop 
      below this limit for the kickdown indication to unlatch. 
      FPP_kickdown_on FPP percentages above this limit will be flagged as 
      active-kickdown in the J1939 EEC2 message. The FPP must drop below the 
      disengagement limit for the kickdown indication to unlatch. 
      FPP_kickdown_src Parameter sets the FPP source for kickdown engagement and 
      disengagement. When set to 'FPP Command', the source is the normalized FPP 
      command (FPP_cmd_pct). When set to 'FPP Position', then the source is the 
      normalized FPP position without modifications from TSC1 requests, cruise 
      control, and roadspeed limiting (FPP_unadjust_pct). 
      FPP_learn_sync_ena This enables synchronized learning of a dual pot 
      (redundant pot) foot pedal. When enabled, learning will occur only if both 
      FPP1 and FPP2 have expired learn wait timers and position voltages 
      below/above their respective idle/full voltages. 
      FPP_mode This switch selects what the FPP1 or FPP1/2 input is used for 
      within the software:
      1) ignored
      2) to determine throttle position
      3) to determine engine speed setpoint

      NOTE: This mode must be enabled (either throttle or speed control mode) 
      before any other foot pedal options apply. 
      FPP_pct Normalized value of FPP position (percentage). Value does include 
      modifications from active TSC1 requests, engaged cruise control, or 
      roadspeed limiting. 
      FPP_stuck_dz Dead zone for detecting a stuck PWM foot pedal. The force 
      idle derate will be active if the minimum and maximum measured foot pedal 
      positions remain less than this value for the calibrated maximum time. The 
      maximum time depends on three position regions defined by "Stuck FPP idle 
      threshold" and "Stuck FPP WOT threshold":
      - infinite for idle foot pedal positions (position < idle threshold)
      - "Stuck FPP WOT time limit" for fully-depressed pedal positions (position 
      >= WOT threshold)
      - "Stuck FPP off-idle time limit" for other off-idle pedal positions 
      FPP_stuck_idle Maximum foot pedal position where stuck pedal detection is 
      disabled. 
      FPP_stuck_offidle_tm Maximum time for an off-idle 
      FPP_stuck_tmr Time foot pedal position has remained within the dead zone. 
      FPP_stuck_wot Minimum foot pedal position for using the maximum time at a 
      fully-depressed pedal position. 
      FPP_stuck_wot_tm Maximum time that the foot pedal is permitted to remain 
      steady in a fully-depressed position. 
      FPP_switch_FPP FPP switch (transition) mode tracking FPP value 
      FPP_switch_FPP_inc FPP command slew rate to use during a speed to throttle 
      control transition if the throttle control command is greater than the 
      (filtered) governor TPS command. Entering '0' here interlocks the current 
      throttle command as the max throttle control command until the user 
      reduces the FPP position. 
      FPP_switch_FPP_tau Additional low-pass filter time constant for foot pedal 
      command. This filter is always actively filtering the governor TPS command 
      (speed control utilizes governor 3) unless a speed to throttle control 
      transition is active. 
      FPP_switch_rpm Entry Value: FPP switch (transition) mode tracking rpm 
      value 
      FPP_switch_rpm_inc Engine speed slew rate to use during a throttle to 
      speed control transition if the speed control command is greater than the 
      (filtered) engine speed. Entering '0' here interlocks the current engine 
      speed as the max speed control command until the user reduces the FPP 
      position. 
      FPP_switch_rpm_tau Additional low-pass filter time constant for engine 
      speed. This filter is always actively filtering the current engine speed 
      unless a throttle to speed control transition is active. 
      FPP_switch_slew_ena This feature allows a slew between foot pedal throttle 
      and speed control modes. It is primarily intended to be used with a 
      hardware pin selecting between user-generated throttle and speed control 
      (governor 3) modes. Note the engine speed/throttle command is always 
      allowed to decrease when a speed/throttle control mode switch occurs 
      (required for safety).

      fric_cold_ena This selection determines if the Cold Friction Torque values 
      are used in conjunction with the Hot Friction Torque values to determine 
      the friction torque reported over J1939. If Disabled, the Hot Friction 
      Torque value is reported over J1939. When ECT or OILT is selected, an 
      interpolation between the Cold and Hot Friction Torque values is 
      calculated based on the Cold Friction and Hot Friction Trigger values. 
      fric_cold_T Cold Friction trigger value: At temperatures equal or below 
      this trigger value, the Cold Friction Torque value will be used. At temps 
      greater than this value and less than the Hot Friction trigger value, the 
      friction will be an interpolation between the CF Torque and HF Torque. 
      fric_hot_T Hot Friction trigger value: At temperatures equal or great than 
      this value, the Hot Friction Torque value will be used. At temps less than 
      this value and greater than the CF trigger value, the friction will be an 
      interpolation between the CF Torque and HF Torque. 
      FRO_ESD_ena If enabled, when using the CD Spark and Knock (SPOCK) 
      controller, if an Emergency Shutdown is requested, fuel run-out will 
      activate prior to the engine stopping to avoid a potential intake backfire 
      upon restart. If an active lockoff fault exists, fuel run-out is skipped 
      regardless of this option's setting and the engine will immediately 
      shutdown. 
      FRO_fuelclear_ms If non-zero, at the end of the fuel runout period, the 
      ECM will close the MJ/EPR fully in order to clear the fuel from the 
      manifold for the subsequent restart (in case of a lockoff failure or 
      extended fuel run-out times). For example, if the "Fuel run-out maximum 
      time" is set to 10000 ms and this parameter is set to 500ms, the engine 
      will operate in fuel run-out mode for the first 9500 seconds after the key 
      is switched off. The MJ/EPR will be closed during the final 500ms, and at 
      the end of the 10000ms period, the engine will be shut down. 
      FRO_gov_state_freeze If enabled, the governor switch state will be frozen 
      when fuel run-out begins. For example, if governor 3 is active and fuel 
      run-out begins, the engine will continue operating on governor 3 during 
      the fuel run-out period. If this option is disabled (default), the engine 
      will switch to the min governor during fuel run-out. 
      FRO_IGN_DIS_ena If enabled, when using the CD Spark and Knock (SPOCK) 
      controller, if an Ignition Disable is requested, fuel run-out will 
      activate prior to the engine stopping to avoid a potential intake backfire 
      upon restart. If an active If enabled, when using the CD Spark and Knock 
      (SPOCK) controller, if an Ignition Disable is requested, fuel run-out will 
      activate prior to the engine stopping to avoid a potential intake backfire 
      upon restart. If an active lockoff fault exists, fuel run-out is skipped 
      regardless of this option's setting and the engine will immediately 
      shutdown. 
      FRO_key_mode This switch determines engine behavior when the key switch is 
      transitioned back to ON following the initial transition to OFF while the 
      engine is running with fuel run-out mode enabled. Normally, the key being 
      transitioned back to on is ignored and the engine will remain in fuel 
      run-out mode until it runs out of fuel and stops or is halted due to a 
      timeout. If this switch is set to 'Continue Running', then the engine will 
      return to a normal running mode if it was still at or above run speed when 
      the key was switched back to ON. 
      FRO_shutdown_ena If enabled, when a fault requiring an engine shutdown 
      occurs, fuel run-out will activate prior to the engine stopping to avoid a 
      potential intake backfire upon restart. If an active lockoff fault exists, 
      fuel run-out is skipped regardless of this option's setting and the engine 
      will immediately shutdown. 
      FRO_sleep If enabled, and EPR is the active fuel system during fuel 
      run-out, the processor will honor the 'Key-off sleep wait' timer and will 
      enter sleep during fuel run-out.

      If disabled, or CFV / MFG is the active fuel system during fuel run-out, 
      the processor will not enter sleep until fuel run-out has completed.

      FSO_ena When parameter is set to 'Enabled - UEGO Cal Only', the UEGO drift 
      compensation feature settings on the 'Inputs' page will determine how 
      often FPP-based fuel shutoff will be engaged.

      When set to 'Enabled - FPP Only', fuel shutoff is allowed based on the FPP 
      position. The active governor must be either Min Gov or Max Gov and the 
      FPP is in the idle position.

      When set to 'Enabled - FPP or Gov3', fuel shutoff is allowed based on the 
      FPP position and Gov3 load. For FPP-based FSO, the active governor must be 
      either Min Gov or Max Gov and the FPP is in the idle position. For 
      Gov3-based FSO, the active governor must be Gov3 and the engine load 
      considered to be low.

      MAP-based fuel shutoff is always enabled. However, MAP-based FSO does not 
      open the throttle. 
      FSO_engbrk_exitwait Delay before exiting fuel shutoff after engine 
      braking. 
      FSO_fault_init FSO UEGO fault ignore time. See FSO_fault_mode for more 
      details 
      FSO_fault_mode If set to 'FSO Active', the FSO EGO/UEGO fault ignore time 
      will be used whenever MAP or FPP based fuel shutoff is active. If 'FSO 
      Active + CL Inactive' is selected, the FSO EGO/UEGO fault ignore time will 
      also be used if CL is inactive due to:
      1. manual forcing of CL inactive
      2. the CL waveform exceeding its authority limit
      3. the CL enable MAP forcing the system into open-loop mode 
      FSO_Gov3_dis_rpm_err When Gov3-based FSO is engaged, FSO will disengage if 
      the Gov3 speed error is less than this parameter. The speed error is 
      defined as the current engine speed minus the governor's target engine 
      speed. Parameter is only applicable if "FSO system" is set to 'Enabled - 
      FPP and Gov3'. 
      FSO_Gov3_ena_rpm_err The minimum allowed Gov3 speed error when engaging 
      Gov3-based FSO. The speed error is defined as the current engine speed 
      minus the governor's target engine speed. Parameter is only applicable if 
      "FSO system" is set to 'Enabled - FPP and Gov3'. 
      FSO_Gov3_load_delta When Gov3-based FSO is engaged, FSO will disengage if 
      the Gov3 desired load increases by this parameter's amount. The increase 
      in desired load is measured from the lowest desired load during the 
      Gov3-based FSO event. Parameter is only applicable if "FSO system" is set 
      to 'Enabled - FPP and Gov3'. 
      FSO_Gov3_load_max The maximum allowed engine load when engaging Gov3-based 
      FSO. Parameter is only applicable if "FSO system" is set to 'Enabled - FPP 
      and Gov3'. 
      FSO_Gov3_timer_init Fuel shutoff validation time for Gov3-based FSO. All 
      Gov3-based FSO engage criteria must be satisfied for this parameter's 
      amount of time before FSO will engage. If FPP-based FSO is already engaged 
      when governor switches to Gov3, then Gov3 validation time will be 
      temporarily overridden to allow FSO to remain engaged. However, Gov3-based 
      FSO criteria must still be met to keep FSO engaged. Parameter is only 
      applicable if "FSO system" is set to 'Enabled - FPP and Gov3'. 
      FSO_idle_off This value is added to the current idle speed target to 
      obtain a speed below which fuel-shutoff is absolutely disabled regardless 
      of any other parameters. 
      FSO_load_delay Parameter is used to calibrate the delay time between FSO 
      disengagement and the estimated engine load becoming greater than zero. 
      The total delay time is calculated as this parameter plus "FSO disengage 
      load transport delay" multiplied by the current transport delay. Parameter 
      is only applicable when "FSO disengage load reduction" is non-zero and 
      "FSO spark retard mode" is set to 'Table Based' on the Spark worksheet. 
      FSO_load_init If enabled, when FSO initially engages, the estimated engine 
      load is assumed to be zero. Upon FSO disengagement, estimated engine load 
      will remain zero until a delay time elapses, refer to "FSO disengage load 
      fixed delay" and "FSO disengage load transport delay". After the delay 
      elapses, this value determines the initial percent reduction in the 
      estimated engine load due to FSO. The reduction is slewed to 0% as the FSO 
      spark retard decays to 0. Set this value to 0 to disable all reductions to 
      estimated engine load during FSO. 
      FSO_load_reduct fuel shutoff reduction in load in pct 
      FSO_load_T_delay Parameter is used to calibrate the delay time between FSO 
      disengagement and the estimated engine load becoming greater than zero. 
      The total delay time is calculated as "FSO disengage load fixed delay" 
      plus this parameter multiplied by the current transport delay. Parameter 
      is only applicable when "FSO disengage load reduction" is non-zero and 
      "FSO spark retard mode" is set to 'Table Based' on the Spark worksheet. 
      FSO_MAP MAP-based FSO engage pressure. Note: MAP-based FSO does not open 
      the throttle. 
      FSO_MAP_hyst Adder above "MAP FSO engage" to exit FSO mode and return to 
      fueling the engine. 
      FSO_ovrspd_TPS_wait This delay timer functions just like the "FSO throttle 
      open delay" timer but is only applicable during an active engine overspeed 
      condition when "Retarder braking during engine overspeed" (Outputs page) 
      is enabled. 
      FSO_phi_delt_wt If non-zero and an active post-cat EGO sensor is 
      available, post-cat delta-phi processing is disabled when exiting fuel 
      shutoff for this period of time. If FSO phi catalyst enrichment is 
      enabled, then this delay timer will start when the enrichment ends. 
      Otherwise, this delay timer starts immediately upon fuel shutoff 
      disengagement. 
      FSO_retard Start/FSO retard 
      FSO_ret_decay Upon an FSO ON->OFF transition (fuel has been turned back 
      on), the value 'FSO spark retard' will be used to initialize a spark 
      retard modifier. It will be decayed back to 0 at the rate given by this 
      value. This is used to generate a smooth power transition as fuel hits the 
      cylinders following FSO. 
      FSO_ret_init Upon an FSO ON->OFF transition (fuel has been turned back 
      on), this spark retard value will be used. It will be decayed back to 0 at 
      the rate given by 'FSO retard decay'. This is used to generate a smooth 
      power transition as fuel hits the cylinders following FSO. 
      FSO_ret_mode Set this value to "Single Point" to use the 'FSO spark retard 
      max' parameter to set the spark retard modifier upon an FSO ON->OFF 
      transition (fuel has been turned back on). The spark retard modifier will 
      be decayed back to 0 at the rate specified by the 'FSO retard decay' 
      parameter.

      Set this value to "Table Based" to use the 'MAP-based Spark Retard' table 
      to determine the spark retard modifier upon an FSO ON->OFF transition. The 
      spark retard modifier is updated based on changing MAP load values and 
      applied for the duration of time specified by the 'FSO Spark Retard Hold' 
      table. Once the hold time expires, the spark retard modifier is decayed 
      back to 0 at a rate calculated from the 'Spark retard decay time' 
      parameter. 
      FSO_rpm_high FSO engage engine speed. Applicable to both FPP-based and 
      Gov3-based FSO. 
      FSO_rpm_low FSO disengage engine speed. Applicable to both FPP-based and 
      Gov3-based FSO. 
      FSO_rpm_mode When parameter set to 'fixed' mode (the default), then all of 
      the RPM-based FSO parameters are taken as absolute values.
      When set to 'idle relative' mode, then all of the RPM-based FSO parameters 
      have an offset added to them = (idle_target-idle_default).

      The FSO parameters affected are:
      "FSO engage speed"
      "FSO disengage speed"
      "FSO throttle open speed"

      An example would be:
      - a cold idle speed of 850 rpm
      - a default warm idle speed of 650 rpm
      - an FSO engage speed of 1400 rpm
      - the new computed FSO engage speed will be 1600 rpm
      - all other RPM-based FSO parameters will also be raised by 200 rpm 
      FSO_rpm_TPSoff Minimum engine speed for opening the throttle during fuel 
      shutoff. 
      FSO_runtime_wait Fuel shutoff will not be allowed prior to this amount of 
      run time on the engine. 
      FSO_timer_init Fuel shutoff validation time for FPP-based FSO. All 
      FPP-based FSO engage criteria must be satisfied for this parameter's 
      amount of time before FSO will engage.

      When "FSO system" is set to 'Enabled - FPP and Gov3', Gov3-based FSO is 
      already engaged, and the active governor switches from Gov3 to Min/Max 
      Gov, then this parameter will be temporarily overridden to allow FSO to 
      remain engaged. However, FPP-based FSO criteria must still be met to keep 
      FSO engaged. 
      FSO_TPSmin Minimum throttle position during fuel shutoff.

      When "FSO throttle open control mode" is set to 'Pre-open UEGO check', 
      this setting is used:
      1. After the "FSO throttle open UEGO limit" condition is met,
      2. After "FSO throttle open delay" lapses following the phi condition, and
      3. When permitted by "FSO TPS/engine brake coordination".

      When "FSO throttle open control mode" is set to 'Post-open UEGO check', 
      this setting is used after the "FSO throttle open delay" time lapses. 
      However, if the pre-catalyst phi does not drop below "FSO throttle open 
      UEGO limit" within a specified time, then the throttle will close. See 
      "FSO throttle open UEGO limit" and "FSO post TPS open UEGO check" 
      descriptions for further details. 
      FSO_TPSmin_braking Fuel shutoff throttle open position during engine 
      braking. 
      FSO_TPSmin_entry Minimum throttle position at entry to fuel shutoff. This 
      position is used after the validation time and before the "FSO throttle 
      open UEGO limit" condition is met. 
      FSO_TPS_coord_ena This option enables coordination of the throttle and the 
      engine brake during FSO. Option can only be enabled if "FSO throttle open 
      control mode" is set to 'Pre-open UEGO check'. If this option is enabled, 
      the following sequence of events will be performed AFTER the UEGO drift 
      sampling has been completed:
      1) Close the throttle
      2) Wait for MAP to drop to the specified "FSO coordination MAP target"
      3) Enable the engine brake
      4) Wait the "FSO coordination TPS reopen delay"
      5) Reopen the throttle 
      FSO_TPS_coord_MAP After initial throttle open period and UEGO drift 
      sample, close TPS and wait for MAP to drop to this target 
      FSO_TPS_coord_wait After MAP has dropped and engine brake has been 
      enabled, wait this amount of time before reopening throttle 
      FSO_TPS_ctrl_mode The 'Pre-open UEGO check' control mode will not open the 
      throttle until the pre-catalyst phi drops below "FSO throttle open UEGO 
      limit" (if non-zero) and the throttle open delay timer expires.

      The 'Post-open UEGO check' control mode will open the throttle after the 
      throttle open delay timer expires, regardless of phi. Phi is subsequently 
      checked after the throttle is open. See description of "FSO post TPS open 
      UEGO check" setting for more details. 
      FSO_TPS_diag_pct Percentage of successful post-open UEGO checks required 
      to reach a diagnostic conclusion for "Failed to reach FSO post throttle 
      open UEGO limit" fault. This setting only applies when "FSO throttle open 
      control mode" is set to 'Post-open UEGO check' and fault is enabled. 
      FSO_TPS_flt_chk_mode Parameter determines how the "Pre-catalyst O2 sensor 
      out of range" fault is checked before allowing the throttle to open during 
      FSO. Parameter is only applicable when a pre-catalyst UEGO sensor is 
      present and "FSO throttle open UEGO limit" is calibrated. When parameter 
      is set to 'Instantaneous (Legacy)', the instantaneous status of the 
      "Pre-catalyst O2 sensor out of range" fault is only checked. If fault's 
      instantaneous status is active, then the throttle is not allowed to open 
      during FSO. When parameter is set to 'Pending or Confirmed', then the 
      fault must be pending or confirmed and active to prevent the throttle from 
      opening during FSO. 
      FSO_TPS_open_tmr FSO TPS open count up timer 
      FSO_TPS_phi_check The maximum time that phi can be greater than "FSO 
      throttle open UEGO limit" with the throttle opened. If this timer expires 
      and phi has not dropped, then the throttle is closed immediately. This 
      setting only applies when "FSO throttle open control mode" is set to 
      'Post-open UEGO check'. Setting must be greater than 0ms, but no more than 
      1000ms. 
      FSO_TPS_spk_kill Kills spark during the throttle open portion of fuel 
      shutoff. 
      FSO_TPS_UEGO_lmt This option should only be enabled if a pre-catalyst UEGO 
      sensor is present.

      When "FSO throttle open control mode" is set to 'Pre-open UEGO check': If 
      this setting is non-zero, the pre-catalyst UEGO-based equivalence ratio 
      must be below this limit before the throttle open delay timer begins.

      When "FSO throttle open control mode" is set to 'Post-open UEGO check': 
      The pre-catalyst UEGO-based equivalence ratio must drop below this limit 
      before the "FSO post TPS open UEGO check" timer expires. Used to verify 
      that equivalence ratio drops while the throttle is open during fuel 
      shutoff. Setting must be greater than 0. 
      FSO_TPS_variable_ena Enables alternative throttle positions during fuel 
      shutoff. When enabled and engine braking is active, the throttle open 
      position is set to "FSO throttle open position during braking". When 
      disabled, or when engine braking is not active, the throttle open position 
      is set to "FSO throttle open position". 
      FSO_TPS_wait This is the delay time between fuel shutoff initiation and 
      the time at which the throttle will be commanded open during FSO throttle 
      open operating windows. This delay time gives the intake manifold time to 
      clear of any residual fuel before raising the MAP due to throttle opening. 

      FSO_TPS_wait_cur This is the delay time between FPP based fuel shutoff 
      initiation and the time at which the throttle will be commanded open 
      during FSO throttle open operating windows. This delay time gives the 
      intake manifold time to clear of any residual fuel before raising the MAP 
      due to throttle opening. The delay is interpolated from the "FSO Throttle 
      Open Delay" table based on road speed. 
      FSO_TPS_wait_mode Specifies whether the fuel shutoff throttle open delay 
      is a single point or interpolated from the "FSO Throttle Open Delay" table 
      based on road speed.

      input values. 
      FTPM_expected_FTP Expected fuel tank pressure, interpolated from the fuel 
      impurity table using the learned fuel impurity and the current fuel tank 
      temperature. 
      FTPM_imp_actv Indicates when conditions are valid for learning fuel 
      impurity. 
      FTPM_imp_dec_tau Decreasing tau for learning fuel impurity after the 
      initial learn time has lapsed. 
      FTPM_imp_inc_tau Increasing tau for learning fuel impurity after the 
      initial learn time has lapsed. A value of 0 seconds disables increasing 
      the learned fuel impurity after the initial learning period. 
      FTPM_imp_inst Instantaneous fuel impurity, calculated when:
      1. fuel flow is greater than the minimum fuel flow for learning fuel 
      impurity, and run time is less than the maximum run time for applying this 
      condition;
      2. fuel flow is less than the maximum fuel flow for learning fuel 
      impurity; and
      3. FTT monitoring state is "Monitoring" 
      FTPM_imp_learn_tau Tau for learning fuel impurity before the initial learn 
      time has lapsed. 
      FTPM_imp_learn_tm Time to rapidly learn fuel impurity at the start of the 
      run cycle. 
      FTPM_imp_lp Learned fuel impurity, updated only when conditions are valid 
      for computing the instantaneous fuel impurity. 
      FTPM_imp_max_idle_tm Maximum run time for applying the minimum fuel flow 
      condition for learning fuel impurity. 
      FTPM_imp_md_f_max Maximum fuel flow for learning fuel impurity. At very 
      high fuel flow rates, the fuel tank pressure may drop. Setting this value 
      to 0 disables the upper fuel flow limit for learning fuel impurity. 
      FTPM_imp_md_f_min Minimum fuel flow for rationalizing FTT and learning 
      fuel impurity. This value is the maximum fuel flow where heat soak into 
      the fuel line from the regulator/engine bay can influence the fuel tank 
      temperature sensor.

      When fuel flow exceeds this value:
      - the tank heat increasing slew rate is used
      - when the fuel tank temperature monitoring state is "Above normal", the 
      state can return to the normal "Monitoring" state (when other conditions 
      are valid)
      - fuel impurity can learn (when other conditions are valid)
      - the minimum fuel tank pressure may increase.

      When fuel flow does not exceed this value:
      - the idle increasing fuel tank temperature slew rate is used 
      FTPM_imp_tmr Elapsed time learning fuel impurity from the start of the run 
      cycle. 
      FTPM_latch_tm Time to latch or unlatch the low fuel pressure state. The 
      low pressure state will latch up when:
      - the fuel impurity initial learn time has lapsed, and the fuel tank 
      pressure is below the minimum expected pressure, based on the current fuel 
      tank temperature and learned fuel impurity.

      The low pressure state and latch timer will latch up immediately when:
      - a lower pressure limit was specified, and the fuel tank pressure is 
      below the lower limit; or
      - the accumulated fuel tank temperature error exceeds the specified limit, 
      interpolated based on the learned fuel impurity.

      The low pressure indication is available over CAN in PGN 65410, SPN 64925. 
      When "Low fuel monitoring input" is set to 'FTPM (LPG) + Fuel level input 
      (Gasoline)' on the DiagConfig worksheet, then the low pressure indication 
      is also available over CAN in PGN 65435, SPN 65161, or PGN 65446, SPN 
      65270. 
      FTPM_latch_tmr Timer for latching or unlatching the low fuel pressure 
      state. 
      FTPM_low Indicates when fuel tank pressure is too low to maintain liquid 
      fuel flow. 
      FTPM_min_FTP Instantaneous minimum fuel tank pressure, calculated as 
      expected fuel tank pressure times the minimum fuel tank pressure 
      multiplier. 
      FTPM_min_FTP_inc_tau Tau for increasing the minimum fuel tank pressure. 
      The tau for decreasing the minimum fuel tank pressure is fixed at 0. 
      FTPM_min_FTP_lim Minimum fuel tank pressure for proper engine operation. 
      If set to 0, the lowest pressure is determined solely by the fuel impurity 
      table, and fuel tank pressure monitoring will be disabled during the 
      initial fuel impurity learning period or during a FTT sensor fault. 
      FTPM_min_FTP_lp Low-passed minimum fuel tank pressure. The low pressure 
      state will latch up when the fuel tank pressure exceeds the low-passed 
      minimum fuel tank pressure. 
      FTPM_min_FTP_mult Multiplier for calculating the minimum fuel tank 
      pressure. The expected fuel tank pressure is interpolated from the fuel 
      impurity table using the learned fuel impurity and the current fuel tank 
      temperature. The minimum fuel tank pressure is calculated as expected fuel 
      tank pressure times the minimum fuel tank pressure multiplier. 
      FTPM_mode When set to "Enabled":
      1. Fuel impurity is learned rapidly near the start of a run cycle, when 
      conditions are valid. The fuel impurity continues to learn slowly after 
      the initial learn period.
      2. A minimum fuel tank pressure is calculated based on the learned fuel 
      impurity and the current fuel tank temperature, when the fuel tank 
      temperature is stable. When the fuel tank temperature is unstable, the 
      minimum fuel tank pressure remains unchanged.
      3. When the fuel tank pressure is below the minimum pressure threshold for 
      the specified latch time, the low fuel pressure state becomes active.

      In the low fuel pressure state:
      1. Closed loop faults and adaptive updates will be disabled if configured 
      to do so. See "Low fuel monitoring input" on DiagConfig worksheet.
      2. Low fuel pressure faults are disabled.
      3. The low fuel pressure status is available in ECI SPN 65161, 65270, or 
      64925.
      4. The low fuel pressure state will become inactive if the fuel tank 
      pressure is above the minimum pressure threshold for the latch time.

      FT_ena Fuel temperature sensor disable/enable switch for gasoline or 
      gaseous injection (gasoline mode). 
      FT_fault_mode Select between voltage and engineering setpoint mode. If the 
      voltage only mode is enabled, the default fuel temperature is used for 
      fuel temperature whenever a fault condition is active. In temperature-only 
      mode, the measured temperature is used for fuel temperature regardless of 
      the fault state. In voltage or temperature mode, the default fuel 
      temperature is used if the voltage out-of-range condition is at least 
      partially responsible for the fault setting. 
      FT_gaseous_ena Fuel temperature sensor disable/enable switch for gaseous 
      regulators/mixers. 
      FT_gsln_slew_att Gasoline slew in attenuation factor during fuel

      FT_input_cfg Defines the fuel types controlled by the select switch, as 
      well as the voltage strategy assigned to each fuel (configured as part of 
      Fuel Switching Control, FT_input_pin) 
      FT_input_pin This switch determines what hardware pin on the ECM is used 
      to switch fuels. 
      FT_MAPsw The manifold pressure must be below this parameter's value before 
      a manual switch to an alternate fuel will be carried out. Parameter is 
      only applicable when "Fuel switch mode" is set to 'Normal'.

      manual switch to an alternate fuel will be carried out. Parameter is only 
      applicable when "Fuel switch mode" is set to 'Normal'. 
      FT_s Standard fuel temperature used for the fuel flow calibration 
      FT_sw_mode Determines the operation of the manual fuel selection toggle 
      switch. When value is set to 'Normal', then the active fuel can be changed 
      by the toggle switch regardless of the engine's operational state. When 
      value is set to 'Stopped Engine', then changes in the toggle switch 
      position are ignored unless the engine is stopped. The legacy modes were 
      never implemented and remain unimplemented. 
      FT_vdr Fuel temperature input pullup resistor configuration 
      fuelclr_auto_ena When set to "Enabled", the "Automatic Fuel Clear" table 
      is used to determine the maximum cranking time with fuel on. When the 
      maximum cranking time with fuel on is exceeded, the table is used to 
      determine the minimum cranking time with fuel off.

      During fuel clearing, for gasoline, the fuel command will be multiplied by 
      "Fuel clear function fuel multiplier"; for gaseous fuels, the fuel command 
      is zero.

      An operator switch and/or foot pedal input will switch automatic fuel 
      clearing into the fuel clearing state. After operator inputs are inactive, 
      fuel clearing will continue for the minimum time specified in the table. 
      fuelclr_auto_rstmode Specifies when to reset the automatic fuel clear 
      timer.

      When set to "After key-off sleep", the fuel on/off cranking time is not 
      reset immediately at key-off, and is reset "Key-off sleep wait" seconds 
      after the key is switched off. In other words, the operator is not allowed 
      to switch the key off to defeat the automatic clearing time.

      When set to "Every key-off", the fuel on/off cranking time is reset when 
      the key is switched off. 
      fuelclr_auto_state State of the automatic fuel clear function. 
      fuelclr_auto_tmr Time that the automatic fuel clear function is in the 
      "Wait for start" or "Clearing" states. 
      fuelclr_chan This switch enables fuel clear mode activation via an 
      auxiliary input when the engine is not running. If “Disabled”, FPP will be 
      used to initiate fuel clear mode. 
      fuelclr_chan_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:

      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG9 = Gnd
      Aux DIG10 = Gnd
      Aux DIG11 = Gnd
      Aux DIG12 = Gnd
      Aux DIG13 = Gnd
      Aux DIG14 = Gnd
      Aux DIG15 = Gnd
      Aux DIG16 = Gnd
      Aux DIG17 = Gnd
      Aux DIG18 = Gnd
      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd

      fuelclr_debounce If "Fuel clear function AUX DIG" is selected and the 
      digital input has been active for more than this time, the fueling command 
      will be multiplied by following multiplier (0.000 < multiplier <= 1.000). 
      fuelclr_FPP If "Fuel clear function Aux DIG" is Disabled and the FPP is 
      greater than this value during cranking, the fueling command will be 
      multiplied by following multiplier (0.000 < multiplier <= 1.000). 
      fuelclr_gaseous Enables fuel clear mode on DEPR gaseous fueled systems. 
      Note: this option has no effect on trim-valve based systems and should not 
      be used on MJ/EPR systems. 
      fuelclr_mult Fueling command will be multiplied by this value if FPP is 
      greater than the Fuel clear function minimum FPP value. 
      fuelclr_requested Indicates when fuel clearing is requested. 
      fuellev_in_ena This switch controls the source of a fuel level input 
      signal.

      When configured as 'Network Source', the following PGN/SPNs are available:
      ECI PGN 42310, SPN 64869
      ECI PGN 42311, SPN 64870 (ECM calculates level from volumes)
      ECI PGN 42312, SPN 64871
      ECI PGN 42313, SPN 64872 
      fuellev_low_latch Amount of time the fuel level must be <= to the Low Fuel 
      Level % to latch a low fuel level condition. The range of values are 0 
      (immediate) to 65 seconds. 
      fuellev_low_pct Defines a low fuel condition for gasoline fueled engines 
      where CL, AL, and low fuel pressure faults are disabled. The associated 
      latch and unlatch timers are used to prevent against false indications 
      during tank slosh. 
      fuellev_low_tmr Fuel level sender - low fuel level latch/unlatch in 
      percent 
      fuellev_low_unlatch Amount of time required for the measured fuel level to 
      be greater than the "Low fuel level" percent before the low fuel level 
      indication is cleared. The range of values are 0 (immediate) to 65 
      seconds. 
      fuellev_pct Fuel level in percent 
      fuellev_pct_def Default fuel level percentage (fuellev_pct). 
      fuellev_ratio_md This switch controls the type of fuel level sender. An 
      'Absolute voltage output' sender's signal is independent of the supply 
      voltage. A '5V ratiometric output' sender is powered by and ratiometric to 
      the ECM's external 5V excitation. A 'Vbat ratiometric output' sender is 
      powered by and ratiometric to the 12V/24V system supply voltage. 
      fuellev_volt Fuel level sender output voltage 
      fuellev_Vstd This value is the standard excitation voltage used for 
      ratiometric output sensors. This value has no meaning for an absolute 
      output sender type.

      (relative to the standard excitation voltage for ratiometric senders) 
      fuellev_V_1 This is the sender output voltage for a 100% fuel level 
      (relative to the standard excitation voltage for ratiometric senders) 
      fuellev_V_inter 1D calibration table: Fuel level corresponding to 25%, 50% 
      and 75% fuel levels (0% and 100% levels contained on separate parameters) 
      fuelrunout_ena Engages a fuel run-out engine stopping mode when the key is 
      turned off on alternate fuels (LPG and NG). In this mode, sparks continue 
      to fire for up to the maximum time specified below or until the engine 
      actually stops with the alternate fuel control lockoff turned off. 
      fuelrunout_max Maximum time that sparks will continue to fire during an 
      alternate fuel engine stopping event with fuel run-out mode enabled. If 
      this parameter is set to 65535 ms, then the run-out time will be extended 
      indefinitely. 
      FuelSpk_SD_active Logical indicating that fuel/spark shutdown is active 
      FuelSpk_SD_input This software switch controls the criteria for an 
      external input pin command of a fuel/spark inhibit either while the engine 
      is cranking or running. Note that this input specification is explicit, 
      and may coincide with a particular state of a fuel-select input channel if 
      desired. 
      FuelSpk_SD_tdelay If this time is nonzero and the min/max momentary window 
      times are zero, this value specifies a non-momentary switch validation 
      delay time to engage fuel/spark inhibit. Note this time is in addition to 
      any latch time required to diagnose an active switch input. Note the timer 
      used to measure the switch delay has a 50ms resolution. 
      FuelSpk_SD_tmax If this time or the min time are nonzero, a momentary 
      switch depressed time must fall between the min/max times for the inhibit 
      to latch as engaged. Note this time is in addition to any latch time 
      required to diagnose an active switch input. Note the timer used to 
      measure button/switch presses has a 50ms resolution. 
      FuelSpk_SD_tmin If this time or the max time are nonzero, a momentary 
      switch depressed time must fall between the min/max times for the inhibit 
      to latch as engaged. Note this time is in addition to any latch time 
      required to diagnose an active switch input. Note the timer used to 
      measure button/switch presses has a 50ms resolution. 
      FuelSpk_SD_tmr ms timer used to measure the fuel/spark shutdown input 
      active time

      pressure trim, or pure open-loop inlet pressure control. The 'Carburetor 
      fuel trim device type' switch and the fuel-specific closed-loop enable 
      switch on the 'CL' page further specify these carbureted control options.

      2) Pulse injection - Pri = pulse type fuel injectors operating on the 
      primary injector drivers (i.e. lower driver numbers - example 1-4 or 1-8 
      if no secondary injection is enabled). The location of all pulse injectors 
      is always indicated by the 'Fuel injection type' switch below - i.e. 
      throttle-body, port, or direct.

      3) Pulse injection - Sec = pulse type fuel injectors operating on the 
      secondary injector drivers (i.e. higher driver numbers - example 5-8) for 
      bi-fuel injected applications. The location of all pulse injectors is 
      always indicated by the 'Fuel injection type' switch below - i.e. 
      throttle-body, port, or direct. This option is not currently supported in 
      EICS.

      4) Continuous injection = CFV (continuous flow valve). The fuel 
      introduction point is always at the throttle body for CFV, but the 
      'Discharge fuel pressure environment' switch above indicates whether the 
      fuel is injected upstream (TIP) or downstream (MAP) of the throttle. This 
      option is not currently supported in EICS.

      5) MFG Injection - Uses the Mass Flow Gas (MFG) device. The "MFG location" 
      setting specifies the location of the MFG device.

      Gen_calcs Generator power configuration 
      Gen_crct_real_pwr Generator corrected real power 
      gen_den_idle_src Selects whether the idle status used to increment the 
      continuous idle runtime is determined internally from the foot pedal input 
      or through receipt of an EEC2 CAN message. This source only applies to the 
      idle status used in general denominator incrementing.

      When “Automatic” is selected, at-idle status is determined internally. 
      This option should be used when a foot pedal input is present.

      When “EEC2 FPP1 at Idle” is selected, at-idle status is received from the 
      Accelerator Pedal 1 Low Idle Switch SPN in an EEC2 CAN message.

      Ginj_cs_active YES/NO indication that peak/hold injection cold start mode 
      is currently active 
      Ginj_cs_ect The engine coolant temperature (ECT) must be below this 
      threshold for the cold start functionality to be active. 
      Ginj_cs_ect_I2 The engine coolant temperature (ECT) must be below this 
      threshold for the cold start functionality to be active. 
      Ginj_cs_max_post This setting specifies the total number of post-run speed 
      injections that should use the higher peak current and extended peak 
      current hold time. This setting provides a way to extend these values for 
      a brief period after the engine starts to ensure all injectors have fully 
      opened.

      Post run-speed injections will only use the cold start peak current and 
      peak hold time if the number of pre-run speed injections did not exceed 
      the configured "Cold start max pre-running injections". 
      Ginj_cs_max_post_I2 This setting specifies the total number of post-run 
      speed injections that should use the higher peak current and extended peak 
      current hold time. This setting provides a way to extend these values for 
      a brief period after the engine starts to ensure all injectors have fully 
      opened.

      Post run-speed injections will only use the cold start peak current and 
      peak hold time if the number of pre-run speed injections did not exceed 
      the configured "Cold start max pre-running injections". 
      Ginj_cs_max_pre This setting controls the peak and hold injection cold 
      start functionality. When enabled if the ECT is below the threshold 
      defined by "Cold start ECT threshold" during engine start then:

      - The higher peak current specified by the "Cold start peak current 
      target" will be used during injection
      - The longer peak current hold time specified by the "Cold start peak 
      current hold time" will be used during injection

      Setting this value to 0 disables the cold start functionality. When set to 
      a value > 0 then up to this number of pre-run speed total injections will 
      use the higher peak current and extended peak current hold time. 
      Ginj_cs_max_pre_I2 This setting controls the peak and hold injection cold 
      start functionality. When enabled if the ECT is below the threshold 
      defined by "Cold start ECT threshold" during engine start then:

      - The higher peak current specified by the "Cold start peak current 
      target" will be used during injection
      - The longer peak current hold time specified by the "Cold start peak 
      current hold time" will be used during injection

      Setting this value to 0 disables the cold start functionality. When set to 
      a value > 0 then up to this number of pre-run speed total injections will 
      use the higher peak current and extended peak current hold time. 
      Ginj_cs_ptime The higher peak current hold time to use when cold start

      Ginj_peak_offset This setting specifies the elapsed time for the injector 
      to turn off from the peak current target as specified by the "Peak current 
      target" setting.

      For instances of short total pulse width injections this setting it used 
      to determine if the hold time should be skipped and the injector should be 
      instead just be turned off from the peak target current. Specifically, if 
      the effective total pulse width time is less than or equal to the peak 
      current hold time plus a small minimal setup time then the hold time will 
      be skipped. 
      Ginj_peak_offset_I2 This setting specifies the elapsed time for the 
      injector to turn off from the peak current target as specified by the 
      "Peak current target" setting. For instances of short total pulse width 
      injections this setting it used to determine if the hold time should be 
      skipped and the injector should be instead just be turned off from the 
      peak target current. Specifically, if the effective total pulse width time 
      is less than or equal to the peak current hold time plus a small minimal

      Gov3_rmt_ff_ena This switch enables a remotely triggered Gov3 feedforward. 
      The only supported trigger signal is from SPN 64867 in ECI PGN 65473. The 
      feature utilizes a single-shot trigger. When the remote signal transitions 
      from inactive to active, a feedforward value is added to Gov3's integral 
      accumulator. The signal must become inactive before another trigger event 
      is allowed. The feedforward value is calculated by interpolating the "Gov3 
      Remote Feedforward" table with the governor's trajectory target. 
      Gov3_rmt_ff_rpm_min The minimum Gov3 target speed allowed while the remote 
      feedforward signal is active. Only applicable when "Gov3 remote

      conditions (using the options below) are required at any roadspeed.

      If set to 'Vehicle, neutral required if stationary', vehicle-interlock 
      safety conditions (using the options below) are required only while the 
      vehicle is stopped. Additionally, the multi-function input will be used 
      for the PTO up to the roadspeed cruise minimum speed.

      gov_gain_aux_cfg When "Governor gain selection aux input" is not set to 
      'Disabled', this parameter determines which gains are active. When 
      configured as '+V = Aux Gains', the auxiliary input gain selections are 
      used when input is connected to +V. When configured as 'GND = Aux Gains', 
      the auxiliary input gain selections are used when input is grounded. 
      Otherwise, the default fuel-based gain selections are used. 
      gov_gain_aux_chan This parameter allows the governor gains to be switched 
      via an auxiliary digital input (Aux DIG). When not set to 'Disabled', the 
      input can switch the governor gains between the default fuel type gain 
      selections and the auxiliary input gain selections.

      gov_ntrlock_chan (For vehicle governing applications only)
      If IVS is selected, the IVS must be off-idle while the FPP is at idle to 
      allow engagement of discrete speed governing modes. If the foot brake 
      input is selected, the foot brake input must be valid before allowing 
      secondary discrete speed governing modes.

      If the 'Neut/Park/Secondary' option is selected, the secondary speed 
      control input and/or the transmission neutral/park safety inputs are used 
      for validation.

      NOTE: The Neut/Park switch must ALWAYS be satisfied if it is enabled, in 
      addition to any secondary setting specified by this parameter. The same is 
      true for the secondary speed switch. This allows for redundant validation 
      of the vehicle interlock.

      gov_rs_ena When the Max Governor is the controlling governor, these 
      multipliers will be used to adjust the governor gains based on the current 
      road speed. The Max Governor "TPS low-pass" time is also adjusted based on 
      the current road speed. 
      Gov_start_wait Value is only applicable when "Gov1/2/3 delay from start 
      mode" is set to 'Time-based'. 
      gov_strt_wait_mode This parameter determines the delay before Gov1, Gov2, 
      or Gov3 can become active after a start.

      When set to 'Time-based', the "Gov1/2/3 delay from start" value is used as 
      the delay.

      When set to 'Warm up complete', the warm-up phase must be completed (hold 
      time elapsed, engine coolant warmed up, and oil temperature warmed up). 
      The "Starting initial speed mode" must be set to 'ECT Table-Based + Warm 
      Up' to use the 'Warm up complete' mode. 
      gov_switchover_time Parameter configures the time allowed to switch the 
      active governor (gov_type). When set to '50 ms (Legacy)', a switch between 
      governors can take up to ~50 ms. When set to '5 ms', the governor will 
      switch in 5 ms. Governors include Min Gov, Max Gov, Gov1, Gov2, and Gov3.

      Gtap_1tap_rpm This the amount the tap up/down speed setpoint will change 
      immediately following 1 button press. 
      Gtap_ena This switch controls the tap up/down speed control system. 
      Gtap_engaged Logical indicating Tap Up/Tap Down system is attempting to 
      set engine speed 
      Gtap_max_rpm This is the upper bound for the speed tap up/down function. 
      Gtap_min_rpm This is the lower bound and initial value for the speed tap 
      up/down function. Additionally, when both up and down buttons are pressed, 
      the engine speed will change immediately to this value. 
      Gtap_ramp_delay When either tap up/down button is held down, this is the 
      wait time (following the governor switch debounce time and "set minimum" 
      debounce time) before the speed will begin continuous ramping. 
      Gtap_ramp_final When either tap up/down button is held down, this is the 
      amount of time (following the delay time) during which the speed ramp rate 
      will be increased from zero to the full ramp rate value. 
      Gtap_ramp_phase When either tap up/down button is held down, this is the 
      amount of time (following the delay time) during which the speed ramp rate 
      will be increased from zero to the full ramp rate value. 
      Gtap_rpm Tap Up/Tap Down target rpm setting 
      Gtap_rpmmin_adjust If engine speed is below this limit, tap up/down 
      setpoint adjustment is disabled. Set this value to '0' to allow tap 
      up/down setpoint adjustments under all conditions. 
      Gtap_setmin_wait Additional debounce time for the Gov1 and Gov2 inputs. A 
      nonzero time here allows the system time to validate a simultaneous Gov1 
      and Gov2 button press without regard to which button is pressed first. 
      However, if nonzero, the tap up/down system will wait the specified time 
      before accepting either input as ON.

      HEX_FSS_DID_tbl Enter the data identifiers (DIDs) to include in an ISO 
      14229-1 UDS Fault Snap Shot. Format each DID as four hexadecimal digits 
      (example: FD03). To include SAE J1979 PIDs (F4xx) in the Fault Snap Shot, 
      use the "FSS PIDs" table instead, as PIDs are not supported in this table. 
      Fault Snap Shots will include both PIDs from the "FSS PIDs" table and DIDs 
      from this table.

      The first occurrence of 0 in this table will signify the end of the DID 
      list. 
      HEX_FSS_PID_tbl Enter the J1979 PIDs to include in a 14229 UDS Fault Snap 
      Shot. Use this list to select a static set of PIDs to be included in each 
      Fault Snap Shot. If the first entry of this list is 0, the Snap Shot PIDs 
      will be dynamically selected based on operating conditions when the Snap 
      Shot is created. The PID values should be entered using hex digits 05 
      (ECT), 0C (RPM), 6B (EGRT), etc. from SAE J1979.

      HSDL_at_ecipp_index Specifies the ECIPP index of the variable whose value 
      should initiate auto-triggering of high speed data logger data collection. 

      HSDL_at_mode Selects the desired high speed data logger auto-trigger mode. 
      If "Disables" auto-triggering is disables and data collection must be 
      initiated manually. If "Rising edge" is selected data collection will 
      automatically begin when the selected auto-trigger ECIPP variable value 
      rises above the selected auto-trigger target. If "Falling edge" is 
      selected data collection will automatically begin when the selected 
      auto-trigger ECIPP variable value falls past the selected auto-trigger 
      target. 
      HSDL_at_target_type This is an internal variable used to provide 
      auto-trigger ECIPP variable's data type to the target device to facilitate 
      auto-triggering value comparison.

      HWARNblk_off A hard warning may cause a continuous output activation or a 
      blinking/pulsing output. The on/off times specify this behavior. For a 
      continuously on output in an active state, simply set the offtime to zero 
      and the ontime to any value. 
      HWARNblk_on A hard warning may cause a continuous output activation or a 
      blinking/pulsing output. The on/off times specify this behavior. For a 
      continuous output in an active state, simply set the offtime to zero and 
      the ontime to any value.

      (ms) 
      HWARNblk_open_on Hard warning open-output transfer Blink/Pulse on-time 
      (ms) 
      HWARNchan_open This switch controls which output pin will be actuated when 
      a hard warning is triggered and the normal hard-warning output is detected 
      to be open. If the MIL, soft, and hard warning channels are set or 
      transferred to the same output, MIL functionality receives the highest 
      priority and soft warning functionality receives the lowest priority. 
      HWARNfcn Hard warning function status (Disconnected, Idle off, MIL, Hard 
      warning, Soft warning, Audible alert) 
      HWARNout_mirror Hard warning output pin

      following an initial keyon/enginestopped event to allow the operator to 
      observe that the output (bulb) is functioning. 
      HWARN_bulbon Hard Warning Output Bulp-Check Config - Determines whether 
      the warning output will be continuously on or blinked/pulsed during the 
      key-on bulb check period. 
      HWARN_chan This switch controls which output pin will be actuated when a 
      hard warning is triggered. A selection of 'None' will not control an 
      output pin, but will continue to communicate a hard warning over the 
      various communications links. In particular, the J1939 'Stop' lamp 
      indication will be on during an active hard warning condition. If the soft 
      and hard warning channels are set to the same output, hard warning 
      functionality (blinking or continuous) takes precedence during an active 
      hard warning. 
      HWARN_lamp Output lamp associated with hardwarning faults.

      IAC_step_int Idle Air Control desired stepping interval 
      IAC_step_max The maximum allowed step position for the IAC if the actual 
      home location is 0. This is the 100% commanded position. 
      IAC_step_min The minimum allowed step position for the IAC if the actual 
      home location is 0. This is the 0% commanded position. 
      IAC_step_park This is the parked location of the stepper prior to 
      power-down of the ECM/driver.

      When the IAT source is configured as 'Standard Input' or 'Aux PU3':
      If ECM hardware supports a software-selectable IAT pullup, then this 
      parameter configures the pullup's value. If the ECM does not support a 
      software-selectable IAT pullup, then the pullup's value is automatically 
      determined by the ECM and this parameter is ignored.

      When IAT source is configured as 'Aux PUD3':
      The ECM hardware must have a 22.1K pullup on Aux PUD3. Likewise, this 
      parameter must be set to '22.1K ohms (fixed)'. The pullup's value is not 
      software-selectable or auto-detected. 
      IBF_action_request Intake backfire action request. Ability to reset both

      backfire is detected when IATdt exceeds "Intake backfire IATdt limit". 
      When set to "MAP", an intake backfire is detected when rMAP exceeds 
      "Intake backfire MAP limit". "IATdt" should be used for boosted engines; 
      "MAP" should be used for naturally aspirated engines.

      ICAV_adpthst_load If enabled, the adaptive progress histogram will be 
      restored at power-on and adaptive progress will continuous from its 
      previous state. If disabled, the adaptive learn sequence must restart 
      before misfire detection will be active. Note that the adaptive tables are 
      always restored, regardless of the setting selected for this option. 
      ICAV_adptT Obsoleted parameter 
      ICAV_adpt_cyl Misfire Statistics - Adaptive Correction 
      ICAV_adpt_dead Adaptation is temporarily shutdown when continuous 
      indicator <= (deadzone %) * continuous threshold. Reasonable deadzone 
      values prevent adaptive parameter drift during steady-state operation 
      while allowing the adaptive tables to converge enough to prevent false 
      misfire diagnostics. Typical values are 10-25%. 
      ICAV_adpt_flt Indicates whether a faulted misfire diagnostic is disabling 
      adaptive updates. 
      ICAV_adpt_flt_ena If enabled, misfire adaptive updates are disabled if any 
      of the misfire diagnostics are in a faulted state. The relevant misfire 
      diagnostics are Misfire detected (cylinders 1-10) and Emissions/catalyst 
      damaging misfire (cylinders 1-10). 
      ICAV_adpt_hires Enables high-resolution mode for adaptive parameter 
      updates. This mode limits adaptive updates to off-axis terms (i.e. cells 
      far away from the current cell), and performs high-resolution adaptive 
      updates during extended steady-state operation. This mode will increase 
      the time required before misfire diagnostics are fully enabled. 
      ICAV_adpt_K Adaptive gain to use for learning steady-state accelerations 
      that are unrelated to misfire (e.g. inconsistent tooth spacing, crankshaft 
      vibrations, bent propellers, etc.). This gain is used in the safe region 
      when the adaptive progress is below the threshold. 
      ICAV_adpt_Khi Adaptive gain to use for learning steady-state accelerations 
      that are unrelated to misfire (e.g. inconsistent tooth spacing, crankshaft 
      vibrations, bent propellers, etc.). If the adaptive progress is above the 
      progress threshold, the adaptive gain shifts from the high to low gain as 
      the continuous indicator grows from the deadzone to the continuous 
      threshold. 
      ICAV_adpt_Klo Adaptive gain to use for learning steady-state accelerations 
      that are unrelated to misfire (e.g. inconsistent tooth spacing, crankshaft 
      vibrations, bent propellers, etc.). If the adaptive progress is above the 
      progress threshold, the adaptive gain shifts from the high to low gain as 
      the continuous indicator grows from the deadzone to the continuous 
      threshold. 
      ICAV_adpt_limit Added a calibratable adaptive table entry limit. Previous 
      implementations automatically saturated at -0.7% and +0.7% speed 
      adaptation. High-output engines will typically require more adaptive 
      correction to handle cylinder-to-cylinder variations. 
      ICAV_adpt_rolloff Rolloff to use when updating adaptive table elements. 
      Adaptive table lookups use a linear combination of 4 table entries. During 
      the adaptive update, each entry is inversely weighted by its distance from 
      the current operating point:

      if weight >= rolloff, weight = weight
      if weight < rolloff, weight = weight^2

      Reasonable values of 0.25-0.35 prevent adaptive estimation drift during 
      steady-state operation by limiting the adaptive updates applied to distant 
      table entries. 
      ICAV_adpt_wt Disables adaptation following a detected misfire. 
      ICAV_cal_assist Misfire calibration assist request (inactive, adaptive 
      learn, thresholds) 
      ICAV_cat_prot Enables and selects the derate table used for misfire 
      catalyst protection. If enabled and any of the misfire or spark coil 
      diagnostics associated with one cylinder have a resolved status of 
      "Confirmed and active", the following actions will be taken:
      - Load limiting will be applied using the derate table selected by this 
      dropdown.
      - EGR minnom command will be forced to -1. EGR load limiting which would 
      normally be active is this case is disabled. The table selected above must 
      be used to control load limit instead.
      - Phi and spark tables will change to the fuel selected by the "Misfire 
      cat protection fuel type" dropdown.

      Note: the "Misfire detected" faults are only checked if "Misfire cat 
      protection - level 1 faults" is set to 'Included'. 
      ICAV_cat_prot_2cyl This value determines what misfire catalyst protection 
      action is taken if any of the misfire or spark coil diagnostics associated 
      with at least 2 cylinders have a resolved status of "confirmed and 
      active". If this value is set to 'Single cylinder option', then the 
      actions associated with single-cylinder misfire catalyst protection are 
      enforced (see the comment for "Misfire cat protection - single cylinder"). 
      If this value is set to 'Engine Shutdown', then a forced shutdown will 
      occur.

      For either option, "Misfire cat protection - single cylinder" must be 
      enabled (i.e. set to one of the load-limit table options). 

      Note: the "Misfire detected" faults are only checked if "Misfire cat 
      protection - level 1 faults" is set to 'Included'. 
      ICAV_cat_prot_act Indicates whether misfire catalyst protection is active. 

      ICAV_cat_prot_fuel Selects the fuel type used for phi and spark tables 
      when misfire catalyst protection is active. 
      ICAV_cat_prot_level1 Parameter determines if the "Misfire detected" faults 
      are apart of the list of faults that trigger misfire catalyst protection. 
      When set to 'Included', then "Misfire detected" faults are checked by both 
      "Misfire cat protection - single cylinder" and "Misfire cat protection - 
      multi-cylinder" features. When set to 'Excluded', then "Misfire detected" 
      faults are not checked. Note: the "Misfire detected" fault reactions set 
      by the fault switches on the Diagnostics worksheet are always honored.

      ICAV_flt_trig Misfire fault trigger threshold 
      ICAV_hires_mult Multiplier to use when performing off-axis high-resolution 
      mode updates. A value of 1.00 limits off-axis adaptive terms to their max 
      possible value * their current interpolation weighting. Values greater 
      than 1.0 allow the off-axis terms to grow towards their maximum values as 
      long as their weighting in the current operating condition is non-zero.

      ICAV_idle_hyst Hysteresis to apply to the 'activate engine speed' when 
      disabling idle mode misfire detection. When a transition to idle mode 
      occurs, misfire detection is initially disabled for a fixed time (see

      ICAV_rdmtrans_wt Number of cycles to disable random misfire detection 
      after detecting a transient condition and restoring continuous misfire

      thresholds while the adaptive progress is less than the adaptive progress 
      threshold. A nonzero multiplier minimizes false-positive misfire

      idle_SD_tout Amount of time in idle and stationary before automatic engine 
      shutdown is initiated. 
      idle_SD_wait_tout Minimum amount of time between the engine entering idle 
      shutdown, and the release of idle shutdown. Entering idle shutdown will 
      stop fuel to the engine. Releasing idle shutdown will resume fuel to the 
      engine. The back-on time specifies the delay that will be imposed between 
      turning off fuel (shutdown initiated) and restoring of fuel (release of 
      the shutdown).

      The back-on time is essentially a fuel transport delay to allow clearing 
      of fuel before spark ignition is resumed.

      usually synchronous to the number of lobes on the high pressure pump. 
      IMV_varcam_mode If the pump/pulsed-IMV are driven by a variable camshaft, 
      this mode allows the firing angle of the IMV to be continuously adjusted 
      based on the current camshaft position. If the pump/pulsed-IMV are driven 
      by a fixed camshaft or some other crankshaft-phase-locked device, this 
      mode should be disabled by selecting the 'Fixed' option.

      timing value represents the 'nominal' or 'cranking' cam timing for which 
      there is zero adjustment to the IMV firing angle. If the actual timing 
      during running advances past this value, the IMV pulse will advance by the 
      same difference.

      The test will not run if any of the following conditions are true: 
      -Engine is not injected
      -Injector individual kill timeout > 60 seconds
      -CL is not running
      -Engine is not running 
      inj_sweep_results Injector sweep test results 
      inj_sweep_state Displays the current status of the injector sweep test. If 
      the test is "Active", this will inform the user what part of the test is 
      currently active, i.e. the ECM is waiting for CL to reach steady state 
      after an injector is tested. If the test is "Disabled", this will inform 
      the user if a test has run since the ECM has been power cycled and whether 
      that test resulted in success or error. 
      inj_sweep_tmr This displays the time elapsed for each time-dependent state 
      in the injector sweep test. When in the "Test Injector n" state, this will 
      display the time elapsed since the injector was killed and will not exceed 
      the value set in "Injector individual kill timeout". When in the 
      "Restoring CL Baseline" state, testing will not begin on the next injector 
      until the time specified in "Injector sweep CL reset delay" has elapsed. 
      inj_sweep_tout This is the maximum continuous amount of time that each 
      injector can remain killed during the individual injector kill part of 
      this test. This time should be sufficient to allow for the CL BM to 
      respond to the killed injector.
      This time cannot exceed 60 seconds. 
      inj_sync_trans_ena This option determines how injection events are handled 
      when transitioning from crank-to-cam synced. It should generally be 
      enabled on new applications and set to 'legacy handling' on old 
      applications.

      1) If legacy handling is used, certain cylinders may experience an extra 
      or missing injection event during the crank-to-cam synchronization 
      transition. Many application parameters affect if individual cylinders 
      will miss or receive an extra injection event: number of cylinders, 
      crank-cam configuration, position of the cam synchronization event, and 
      cranking injection timing. Note that if the initial crank position guess 
      is correct, all injection events are correct. If the initial crank 
      position guess is incorrect and gets corrected when the cam synchronizes, 
      certain cylinders may experience an extra or missing injection event. The 
      behavior is consistent and repeatable, however, so leaving this set to 
      'legacy handling' is the recommended mode for old applications.

      a. For waste-spark and distributed ignition applications, injections are 
      typically started while only crank-synced. On the transition to 
      cam-synced, certain cylinders may receive an extra injection event while 
      other cylinders may go a cycle without fuel.

      b. For coil-on-plug applications, all injectors will typically fire when 
      cam synchronization occurs. If a cylinder fires just after or near the 
      closing of the intake valve and the fuel does not enter the cylinder 
      immediately, that cylinder may receive an extra injection event. A 
      double-event is more likely to occur on 8 cylinder applications and less 
      likely on 4 cylinder applications.

      2) If enabled, all prior and future injection events are individually 
      analyzed when cam synchronization occurs. If a prior event finishes at 
      least 45 CAD BBDCI, it is considered to have entered on the 
      previous/current intake event. If a prior event finishes after 45 CAD 
      BBDCI, it is considered late and will enter in the next engine cycle so 
      the event on the next cycle is skipped in order to avoid double 
      injections. Similarly, if an event is late but can complete before 45 CAD 
      BBDCI, it is immediately fired. If the event is late and cannot complete 
      before 45 CAD BBDCI, the injection event is skipped. 

      NOTE: For GM distributed applications, 30 CAD BBDCI is used instead of 45 
      CAD BBDCI.

      IPAS_engaged Indicates when the idle pull away speed is engaged. 
      IPAS_mode Sets engagement and disengagement conditions for using an 
      elevated idle speed to improve vehicle pull away performance.

      If set to "Vehicle speed only", the elevated idle speed will be used if 
      roadspeed exceeds the engagement speed, and the normal idle speed will be 
      used if roadspeed drops below the maximum disengagement speed.

      If set to "Vehicle speed + parking brake", the elevated idle speed will be 
      used if vehicle speed conditions are met, or if the transmission is in 
      gear and the parking brake is inactive.

      If set to "Vehicle speed + parking brake + foot brake", the elevated idle 
      speed will be used if vehicle speed conditions are met, or if the 
      transmission is in gear, the parking brake is inactive, and the foot brake

      J1939_EBC1_SD_tout Minimum amount of time between setting EBC1 Engine 
      Auxiliary Shutdown Switch (SPN 970) and the clearing of the Engine 
      Auxiliary Shutdown Switch. Setting the Engine Auxiliary Shutdown Switch 
      will stop fuel to the engine and then subsequent clearing of the Engine 
      Auxiliary Shutdown Switch will resume fuel to the engine. The back on time 
      specifies the amount of delay that will be imposed between turning off 
      fuel (shutdown request) and restoring of fuel (clearing of the shutdown 
      request). The delay is essentially a fuel transport delay to allow 
      clearing of fuel before spark ignition is resumed. 
      J1939_EC1_droop For Engine Configuration Map-Mode 1 operation, allow the 
      point 6 value to be independent of the point 2 value.

      This only applies to calculating point 6 for droop mode. In isochronous 
      mode, point 2 and point 6 are always the same value.

      This setting also controls the torque percentages reported for ISO 15031-5 
      PID 0x64 / ISO 14229 DID 0xF464 - "Engine Percent Torque Data". 
      J1939_EC1_pt7_rpm Parameter is the value of SPN 533 in EC1 which is the 
      maximum momentary override speed (Point 7). Value is only applicable when 
      "J1939 EC1 point 7 override speed source" is set to 'Calibration'. 
      J1939_EC1_pt7_src Parameter configures the source of SPN 533 in EC1 which 
      is the maximum momentary override speed (Point 7). When parameter is set 
      to 'Point 6 (Legacy)', then Point 7 is set equal to Point 6. When 
      parameter is set to 'Calibration', then Point 7 is set equal to the value 
      of "J1939 EC1 point 7 override speed". 
      J1939_EC1_pt7_time Parameter is the value of SPN 534 in EC1 which is the 
      maximum time limit allowed to override the engine's high idle speed. Set 
      to 0.0 seconds to indicate that high-idle override is not allowed. The 
      maximum valid time is 25.0 seconds. If parameter is greater than 25.0 
      seconds, then time limit is disabled (broadcasted value will be 0xFF). 
      J1939_EC1_rpm_src Parameter configures the J1939 EC1 engine speed values 
      for points 3, 4, and 5 (SPN 529-531). When set to 'Evenly Distributed 
      (Legacy)', the speed values are evenly distributed between point 1 and 
      point 2. When set to 'Table-Based', the "J1939 EC1 Speed Points" table on 
      the 'Estimators' worksheet is used.

      Engine speed and torque values may be derated. See "J1939 EC1 variable 
      rate reporting" on the 'Comms' worksheet for configuring dynamic points. 
      J1939_EEC1_low_idle Parameter determines when the Engine Torque Mode (SPN 
      899) in EEC1 is set to low idle governor (0b0000). When parameter is 'Min 
      Gov Engaged (Legacy)', then the minimum governor must be engaged 
      (gov_type_engaged = 4). When parameter is 'Min Gov or FPP at Idle', then 
      either the minimum governor must be engaged or the FPP is at idle. This 
      option handles scenarios where no governor is engaged (gov_type_engaged = 
      0) and the accelerator pedal is at idle. The engine speed has not fallen 
      low enough to engage the minimum governor. 
      J1939_EEC1_SPN_ena Obsoleted parameter 
      J1939_EEC1_torq_lmt Determines how the Engine Torque Mode (SPN 899) 
      parameter transmitted in the Electronic Engine Control 1 (EEC1) PGN is 
      encoded when received TSC1 requests are actively limiting the engine 
      torque. When enabled, the EEC1 PGN will transmit the engine torque mode 
      associated with the TSC1 torque limit request when the desired engine load 
      is below the requested limit. Otherwise, SPN 899 is encoded with the 
      actual torque mode generating, limiting, or controlling the engine load 
      when below the TSC1 torque limit (e.g. accelerator pedal/operator 
      selection, high speed governor, etc.).

      J1939_ETC_loss This is the time after an engine run condition is detected 
      that a failure to receive a electronic (network) throttle position command 
      message will cause this fault to begin setting validation. 
      J1939_ETC_loss2 ETC (electronic throttle command) message loss during 
      engaged gear situation 
      J1939_exr_torque_tbl If set to "Percentage", then exhaust brake torque is 
      computed as a percentage of the "Retarder Torque" column. The percentage 
      is specified by the "Exhaust brake percent of retarder torque" parameter.

      If set to "Separate Table", then engine/drivetrain braking torque is 
      interpolated from the "Engine Retarder Torque" column, and the exhaust 
      braking torque is interpolated from the "Exhaust Retarder Torque" column. 
      J1939_FPPdual_idle This parameter determines how the "Accelerator Pedal 1 
      Low Idle Switch" (SPN 558) parameter in the J1939 EEC2 PGN is encoded when 
      a dual pot FPP is enabled and an IVS switch is not available.

      If set to 'Not Allowed', SPN 588 is encoded with 11b = Not Available.

      If set to 'FPP command idle', the FPP command at-idle indication is used 
      to set SPN 558 to either 00b = Accelerator pedal 1 not in low idle 
      condition or 01b = Accelerator pedal 1 in low idle condition.

      For the 'Report FPP during TSC1' option, SPN 558 in EEC2 will use the FPP 
      pedal position idle threshold for the dual pot FPP during TSC1 override of 
      the FPP command. This switch will allow reporting of the pedal FPP idle 
      indication in SPN 558 while TSC1 override of the FPP command is active.

      The 'FPP position idle' option always uses the FPP pedal position idle 
      threshold to determine how to encode SPN 558. 
      J1939_fuel_rate_acc Current low-pass filtered J1939 engine gas mass flow 
      rate 
      J1939_fuel_rate_FT1 Specifies the encoding of the J1939 EI PGN Engine Gas 
      Mass Flow Rate 1 parameter. If the selection does not match the active 
      fuel type, then the SPN is encoded with 0 kg/h. 
      J1939_fuel_rate_FT2 Specifies the encoding of the J1939 GFI3 PGN Engine 
      Fuel System 2 Gas Mass Flow Rate parameter. If the active fuel type is not 
      gaseous (LPG/NG) or the selection does not match the active fuel type, 
      then the SPN is encoded with 0 kg/h. 
      J1939_fuel_rate_mode This selection determines which fuel rate is 
      broadcast in PGN 65266, "Liquid Fuel Economy" for SPN 183, "Engine Fuel 
      Rate." This selection also determines which fuel rate is reported for ISO 
      15031-5 PID 0x5E / ISO 14229 DID 0xF45E - "Engine Fuel Rate" and ISO 
      15031-5 PID 0x9D / ISO 14229 DID 0xF49D - "Fuel Rate"

      accuracy of broadcast fuel consumption 
      J1939_fuel_rate_tau Specifies the time constant used for the J1939 engine 
      gas mass flow rate low-pass filter. 
      J1939_GFC_ena Enables two Gaseous Fuel Consumption (GFC) low-pass filters 
      which provide the data reported in proprietary J1939 PGN 65001 and 65002. 
      Filter 1 provides the data for PGN 65001 and Filter 2 provides the data 
      for PGN 65002.

      The two low-pass filters use the currently active fuel's Actual Specific 
      Gravity to allow reporting of the GFC mass as a volume.

      The GFC mass and volume are reported as consumption per hour and as 
      consumption per 100 km if a roadspeed input is available.

      portion of the DM messages. If disabled, all J1939 MIL indications will be 
      '0'. Standard practice is to leave this feature enabled. 
      J1939_MIL_mode This switch determines the MIL status in the J1939_lamps 
      DM1 message portion during a key-on/engine-stopped condition. Standard 
      practice is to indicate that the MIL is on continuously in this state. 
      Alternatively, the MIL can only be indicated as continuously on or 
      blinking off every 5 seconds in this state if there are stored fault codes 
      in the system. This switch has no impact on the hardware pin controlled 
      MIL output on the ECM.

      LNG applications should set this value to 600 or 610. 
      J1939_PGN_tout List of EControls cal 16-bit decimal PGNs to be monitored 
      for timeout by the custom J1939 PGN timeout faults. These values are not 
      necessarily the same as the actual J1939 PGNs seen on the CAN bus. See 4G 
      CAN documentation spreadsheet for details.

      A value of 65535 disables the corresponding fault. 
      J1939_PGN_tout_keytm This is the time after a key on condition is detected 
      that a failure to receive the specified PGN will cause the timeout faults 
      below to latch.

      If this value is set to 0, key state will be ignored and a minimum key on 
      time will not need before the faults are able to latch. 
      J1939_PGN_tout_runtm This is the time after an engine run condition is 
      detected that a failure to receive the specified PGN will cause the 
      timeout faults below to latch.

      If this value is set to 0, engine run state will be ignored and the faults 
      will be able to latch even if the engine is not running. 
      J1939_RC_SA_ena This selection determines the source address(es) for PGN 
      65249 (Retarder Configuration) messages:
      - Default: the RC PGN Source Address will be the ECU address
      - Engine Retarder (15): the RC PGN Source Address will be 15
      - Exhaust Retarder (41): the RC PGN Source Address will be 41
      - Both + torque curves: the RC PG will be sent from Source Address 15 when 
      ECI PGN 42350 is in the "Supported Tx PGN List", and sent from Source 
      Address 41 when ECI PGN 42349 is in the "Supported Tx PGN List". 
      Additionally, the torque curve SPN's will be set according to the engine 
      retarder and exhaust retarder tables for the current fuel type. (For all 
      other selections, the torque curve SPN's are reported as Not Available.) 
      J1939_rc_torque_ref This is the 'reference torque' used in the J1939 
      'Retarder Configuration' (RC) PG used as a scale basis for the torque 
      curve delivered in this packet. It MUST be greater than or equal to the 
      highest torque entered in the retarder torque range calibration below. In 
      general, it should always be at least 20% higher than the highest torque.

      J1939_spark_KV CD spark KV in block order for transmission over J1939. 
      J1939_static_pwr If set to a non-zero value, specifies a fixed value to be 
      transmitted for the Engine Rated Power SPN in the EEC4 J1939 message. When 
      this setting is left at its default value of 0, the rated power will be 
      calculated normally by the ECM torque/power estimation system. 
      J1939_torque_pct_tbl This selection determines the value broadcast in SPN 
      92 'Engine Percent Load at Current Speed.' The default is governor tables, 
      which is determined from the MAP full-load/no-load table used for 
      governing. If the engine torque estimation table below is fully 
      calibrated, select 'J1939 Torque Tables, Indicated %'. The governor load 
      table provides a reasonable estimate (though it will have error near the 
      no-load/full-load endpoints) if the table below has not been calibrated. 
      For naturally aspirated engines, select 'J1939 Torque Tables, Indicated %, 
      Baro Corrected' to correct the torque estimate for altitude. The 'J1939 
      Torque Tables, Net %' and 'J1939 Torque Tables, Net %, Baro Corrected' 
      options exist only for backwards compatibility and should not be used. 
      J1939_TP_BAM This switch optionally enables TP.BAM (broadcast) for all 
      J1939 Transport Protocol (TP) messages. 

      If disabled, TP.BAM or TP.CM messages are selected per the SAE J1939-21 
      specification and the contents of the received PGN request. 
      J1939_TP_mod This switch selects which modifications to the
      CAN ID should be made when sending J1939 Transport Protocol (TP) messages.
      This includes TP.CM and TP.DT messages.The CAN priority for J1939 TP 
      messages can be set to 6 instead of the J1939-21 standard priority 7. 
      J1939_TSC1_loss This is the time after an engine run condition is detected 
      that a failure to receive a TSC1 message will cause this fault to begin 
      setting validation. 
      J1939_TSC1_loss_mode Specifies how to handle TSC1 messages after the 
      "J1939 TSC1 message receipt lost" fault has latched.

      If "Normal" is selected, then TSC1 message handling does not change after 
      the fault latches.

      If "Negative torque requests and negative torque limits" is selected, then 
      after the fault latches:
      - Speed requests: ignored
      - Torque requests: Only negative torque permitted
      - Speed limits: ignored
      - Torque limits: Only zero and negative torque permitted

      If "Negative torque requests and all torque/speed limits" is selected, 
      then after the fault latches:
      - Speed requests: ignored
      - Torque requests: Only negative torque permitted
      - Speed limits: permitted
      - Torque limits: permitted

      J1939_TSC1_mode Select the J1939 TSC1 prioritization scheme for handling 
      multiple valid TSC1 requests. The default option uses the most recent 
      message and ignores previous messages. The lowest-limit option is a 
      modified version of Figure SPN695_A in J1939-71 Instead of defaulting to 
      the oldest message, this option takes the minimum speed limit and minimum 
      torque limit and from all valid messages and implements them 
      simultaneously. The following approach is used:

      1. The highest priority (SPN 897) messages are accepted. If a lower 
      priority message is valid at the same time as a higher priority message, 
      it is discarded completely.
      2. If any message requests speed control and remote speed requests (above) 
      is set to 'Full Authority', speed control mode becomes active. The target 
      speed is the lowest speed from all valid speed control or speed limit 
      requests. A torque limit can be simultaneously applied using the lowest 
      torque control or torque limit request from all valid messages.
      3. If any message requests torque control and torque control requests 
      (above) is set to 'Full Authority', torque control becomes active. The 
      target torque value is the lowest torque from all valid torque control or 
      torque limit requests. A speed limit can be simultaneously applied using 
      the lowest speed limit from all valid speed limit messages.
      4. Simultaneous speed/limit requests using the lowest speed/torque limit 
      values. 
      J1939_TSC1_P1_ena Parameter configures the arbitration method and usage of 
      TSC1 messages with a P1 control purpose. P1 messages are identified by SPN 
      3350 set to a value of 0 and are intended for control of the accelerator 
      pedal. When parameter is set to 'Disabled', then received P1 TSC1 messages 
      are arbitrated with all other P32 messages and considered temporary 
      powertrain control.

      When set to 'Enabled - Verification Optional' or 'Enabled - Verification 
      Required', then P1 messages are excluded from normal arbitration. Instead, 
      P1 messages with a torque control request are converted to a foot-pedal 
      percentage and stored into FPP1_pct. If multiple messages are received, 
      then the lowest torque is selected. P1 messages with a control mode not 
      equal to torque control (value of 2) are discarded. Requested torque 
      values <= 0% will result in FPP1_pct = 0%. The following calibration is 
      required:
      - "Primary foot pedal mode" is set to 'Network Throttle'
      - "Secondary foot pedal mode" is set to 'Disabled'
      - "Dual pot pedal" is set to 'Disabled'.

      The term "verification" refers to verification of the TSC1 message in 
      accordance with SPN 4206 and SPN 4207. When parameter is set to 'Enabled - 
      Verification Required', then the message checksum and counter must be 
      received (not equal to 0xff). If the SPNs are not received or not valid, 
      then message is discarded. When parameter is set to 'Enabled - 
      Verification Optional', then SPN 4206 and 4207 are only checked if they 
      are received and their associated diagnostics are enabled.

      All FPP modifications/filtering are still available to use if desired, 
      such as: idle/full valid deadzones, dashpot filtering, slew-rate limiting, 
      non-linear mapping, FPP Unidirectional Filtering (FUF), cubic deadzone 
      limiting, etc. However, enabling the idle/full deadzones or non-linear 
      mapping will result in the engine controlling to a different steady-state 
      torque than what was requested by the P1 message.

      Only specific TSC1 messages support SPN 3350. See CAN documentation. 
      J1939_TSC1_P2_ena Parameter configures the arbitration method and usage of 
      TSC1 messages with a P2 control purpose. P2 messages are identified by SPN 
      3350 set to a value of 1 and are intended for cruise control. When 
      parameter is set to 'Disabled', then any received P2 TSC1 messages are 
      arbitrated with all other P32 messages and considered temporary powertrain 
      control.

      When set to 'Enabled - Verification Optional' or 'Enabled - Verification 
      Required', then P2 messages are excluded from normal arbitration. Instead, 
      P2 messages with a torque control request are converted to a engine load 
      percentage and stored into RMT_P2_load. If multiple P2 messages are 
      received, then the lowest torque is selected. P2 messages with a control 
      mode not equal to torque control (value of 2) are discarded. Requested 
      torque values <= 0% will result in 0% engine load. To use the P2 messages, 
      "Roadspeed cruise control device" must be set to 'External - P2 Torque 
      Control' on the Roadspeed worksheet. See "Roadspeed cruise control device" 
      for more details. When cruise control is enabled (RSC_enabled) and a valid 
      P2 torque control message is received, then cruise control will engage and 
      RMT_P2_load will be stored into the min FPP governor (RS_min_FPP).

      The term "verification" refers to verification of the TSC1 message in 
      accordance with SPN 4206 and SPN 4207. When parameter is set to 'Enabled - 
      Verification Required', then the message checksum and counter must be 
      received (not equal to 0xff). If the SPNs are not received or not valid, 
      then message is discarded. When parameter is set to 'Enabled - 
      Verification Optional', then SPN 4206 and 4207 are only checked if they 
      are received and their associated diagnostics are enabled.

      Only specific TSC1 messages support SPN 3350 (ECI SPN 3349). See CAN 
      documentation. 
      J1939_TSC1_pre_filt Parameter configures pre-arbitration filtering of TSC1 
      requests as defined by the J1939 standard. When set to 'Enabled - Filter 
      SPN 695', then any TSC1 with SPN 695 equal to 0 (override disabled) will 
      be excluded from arbitration. The SPN 695 pre-arbitration filter was added 
      to the J1939 standard in February 2017 to reduce undesired arbitration 
      interactions. "Override Disabled" commands are not a request for active 
      control and therefore they do not need to be arbitrated. However, if such 
      TSC1 commands are arbitrated and have an elevated priority, their 
      inclusion in the arbitration process can interfere with other TSC1 
      commands that are requesting active control. 
      J1939_TSC1_rx_tout If set to a non-zero value, this parameter overrides 
      the default timeout for all TSC1 messages.

      keysw_type If the key switch is set to 'Automatic', reprogramming and 
      flash page commits are allowed without requiring a key-on condition. 
      Setting the key switch to automatic also prevents the ECM from entering a 
      low-power sleep state while the PC display is connected.

      If the key switch is set to 'Manual', reprogramming and flash page commits 
      will not begin unless the key switch is on. 
      key_offrel_valid Time to wait after the relative key switch voltage is 
      below the trigger before validating a key-off condition. 
      key_off_clr_active Key-off clear active time (seconds) 
      key_off_clr_EGR EGR valve command during the key-off relay on clear 
      period. 
      key_off_clr_EGR_cnt Selects the number of close/open cycles performed 
      after key-off when the 'Key-off clear with relay on' is set to 'Clear and 
      zero'. 
      key_off_clr_EGR_DC Selects the EGR valve duty-cycle to use after key-off 
      when the 'Key-off clear with relay on' is set to 'Clear and zero'. Selects 
      the duty-cycle used during the zero-position determination. 
      key_off_clr_EGR_ena Enables a series of EGR valve opens and closes to 
      clear any deposits which formed during the drive cycle. After the series 
      of opens and closes, the valve will be supplied a fixed Duty Cycle to 
      determine an updated 0% valve open feedback voltage.

      NOTE: This should only be used when Key-off clear with relay on is enabled 
      and with H-Bridge controlled EGR valves. The Key-off clear hold time must 
      be sufficient to allow the selected number of Key-off clear EGR cycles and 
      zero voltage determination to complete. 
      key_off_clr_EGR_V Selects the EGR valve voltage target to use during the 
      close/open cycles performed after key-off when the 'Key-off clear with 
      relay on' is set to 'Clear and zero'. The artificially lowered close 
      voltage allows the valve to hard close to remove valve seat deposits. 
      key_off_clr_ena If enabled, the relay will turn on following an engine 
      stopped situation in order to allow residual water to drain from the EGR 
      valve (and potentially the throttle). During this period, pressure pegging 
      might also be active.

      'Clear and zero' will also include a series of EGR valve opens and closes 
      to clear any deposits which formed during the drive cycle. After the 
      series of opens and closes, the valve will be supplied a fixed Duty Cycle 
      to determine an updated 0% valve open feedback voltage. NOTE: 'Clear and 
      zero' should only be used with H-Bridge controlled EGR valves, and the 
      Key-off clear hold time must be sufficient to allow the selected number of 
      Key-off clear EGR cycles and zero voltage determination to complete. 
      key_off_clr_hold Duration of the clear procedure. 
      key_off_clr_TPS Throttle command during the key-off relay on clear period. 

      key_off_clr_wt Wait period following a confirmed engine-stopped situation 
      before the clear sequence begins. 
      key_off_sleep Key-off/on abs trigger. Absolute trigger voltage for 
      determining key-off or key-on state. 
      key_off_valid Time to wait after the key switch voltage is below the 
      absolute trigger before validating a key-off condition. 
      key_on_relay_force This option forces the RELAY output to ON when key-on. 
      The RELAY output normally enables distribution of high side power to 
      components needed while the engine is running. The starter and other 
      components that are needed before the engine is running are not normally 
      powered based on the RELAY output. Using this option to force RELAY ON is 
      a non-standard configuration and should only be used if the wiring harness 
      cannot be modified to a standard configuration. 
      key_on_wait Time to wait on gasoline after a key-on condition exists with 
      the engine stopped before turning off the fuel-pump, throttle, ... until 
      engine motion is detected. Alternate fuels have their own timeout. The 
      fuel pump may be alternatively disabled earlier than this value using the 
      fuel pump stopped wait value. 
      key_on_waitalt Time to wait on gaseous (alternate) fuels after a key-on 
      condition exists with the engine stopped before turning off the lockoff, 
      throttle, ... until engine motion is detected. Gasoline has its own 
      timeout. The lockoff may be alternatively disabled earlier than this value 
      using the lockoff stopped wait value. 
      key_trigrel_volts Key-off rel trigger - Relative trigger voltage between 
      the switched and continuous battery supplies for determining key-off or 
      key-on state.

      KNK_CWT_mult In the calculation of the knock voltage thresholds, this 
      multiplier will be used with the CWT % to elevate the Light Knock voltage 
      level based on the CWT %.

      If this multiplier is > 0 and if CWT % is greater than 0, the following 
      adjustments to the Light Knock (0%) and Heavy Knock (100%) voltage levels 
      are made:

      0Vdelta = (CWTmultiplier * CWT%) * 0V
      0V = 0V + 0Vdelta
      100V = 100V + 0Vdelta 
      KNK_CWT_mult_legacy Legacy knock CWT multiplier only used with software 
      versions less than 305. Newer versions use KNK_CWT_mult.

      In the calculation of the knock voltage thresholds, this multiplier will 
      be used with the CWT % to elevate the Light Knock voltage level based on 
      the CWT %.

      If this multiplier is > 0 and if CWT % is greater than 0, the following 
      adjustments to the Light Knock (0%) and Heavy Knock (100%) voltage levels 
      are made:

      0Vdelta = (CWTmultiplier * CWT%) * 0V

      KNK_enable Enables or disables knock control. To activate knock control, 
      set this parameter to 'Enabled - ECM only' for applications in which the 
      ECM is monitoring the knock sensors and performing knock control 
      processing. Otherwise, if an ECM is paired with a SPOCK device to perform

      KNK_FSO_debounce Minimum time that must be spent in fuel shutoff before 
      knock control is disabled.

      Set to 0 to disable FSO knock disable.

      Once this debounce time has been reached, knock control is immediately 
      disabled and remains so until fuel shutoff is exited and the extra disable 
      time has elapsed. 
      KNK_FSO_disabled Indicates when knock control is disabled due to fuel 
      shutoff. 
      KNK_FSO_disabled_tm Additional time that knock control will remain 
      disabled after the engine has left fuel shutoff. This must be set to a 
      non-zero value in addition to the debounce time above in order to enable 
      the FSO knock disable feature. 
      KNK_FSO_min_mdot Minimum fuel flow at which knock FSO threshold will 
      continue to decrease to 0. If fuel flow is below this value, the knock FSO

      KNK_HW_scale The internal hardware gain of the incoming raw knock signal 
      for a fixed gain platform, or the low gain for a duel gain capable ECM 
      platform. Typically, the input amp has a gain of 0.332 feeding a +/ 1.65V 
      A/D input, so the HW gain is approximately 4.97 V/full scale RMS. 
      KNK_HW_scale2 The internal hardware gain of the incoming raw knock signal 
      when in the high gain setting on a dual gain capable ECM platform. 
      Typically, the input amp has a gain of 3.00 feeding a +/ 1.65V A/D input, 
      so the HW gain is 0.55 V/full scale RMS. 
      KNK_Ksel This switch selects the knock circuit analog input gain for 
      either a tuned response (low gain), or flat response (high gain) sensor

      LLAdapt_dld_max This is the maximum (positive) % load-limit adaptation 
      delta allowed. It is >= 0. 
      LLAdapt_dld_min This is the minimum (negative) % load-limit adaptation 
      delta allowed. It is <= 0. 
      LLAdapt_dload This is the current loadlimit adaptation offset in % load 
      that is added to the base calibrated loadlimit to achieve a match with the 
      calculated engine load. 
      LLAdapt_ena Enables/Disables load-limit target adaptation to compensate 
      for variations in the throttle model, air pulsation throttle model flow 
      disturbances, ... 
      LLAdapt_frz_wait This is the number of ms that the system will delay 
      before engaging load-limit adaptation following authority engagement of 
      the load-limit TPS value. The last load-limit adaptation offset stays 
      intact whenever load-limit is not in authority. 
      LLAdapt_Ki This is the integrator gain for the load-limit delta 
      adaptation. An error of 5% in load will be adapted at a rate of 5%/sec if 
      this gain is set to 1.00. 
      LLAdapt_slew_lim This is the load-limit adaptation slew limit in % load 
      per second. It is a positive number which is used to limit the adaptation 
      movement symmetrically in both the positive and negative directions. 
      LLgear_axle_ratio Drive axle ratio used to calculate the gear ratio to 
      determine the current transmission gear. Parameter is only applicable when 
      "Gear-based load-limiting" is set to 'Enabled - Cal Based'. 
      LLgear_dir Transmission gear direction indicator input status:
      0 = Forward
      1 = Reverse
      2 = Error / Fault
      3 = Not Available
      4 = Park
      5 = Neutral 
      LLgear_dir_cfg When "Gear direction input" is configured as an Aux DIG 
      input, then this value determines the active logic state(s). An active 
      input state indicates reverse direction while an inactive state is forward 
      direction. When parameter is set to 'Default', the active state is defined 
      as follows:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd

      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      LLgear_dir_input Selects the input source for determining the 
      transmission's gear direction. An active input state indicates reverse 
      direction while an inactive state is forward direction. When parameter is 
      set to 'Disabled', the gear direction is defaulted to forward. When set to 
      'CAN sourced', the gear direction is received from SPN 1622 in ECI PGN 
      65132 or 65422. If SPN is not received or in error, then the direction is 
      defaulted to forward. Parameter is only applicable when "Gear-based 
      load-limiting" is set to 'Enabled - Cal Based'. 
      LLgear_ena When set to 'Enabled - Cal Based', the 4G ECM will determine 
      the current transmission gear by performing a lookup in the gear-based 
      load-limiting table using the calculated gear ratio. The gear ratio is 
      calculated from the tire circumference, drive axle ratio, engine speed, 
      and vehicle speed. Once the current gear is determined, the associated 
      "Load-Limit Source" selection specifies which Speed-Based Load Limit table 
      is used to look up the maximum allowed load based on engine speed. When 
      set to 'Enabled - CAN Based', the current transmission gear is obtained 
      through ETC2.

      In addition to enabling this parameter, set the "Load-limiting system" 
      parameter above to either standard or expanded mode in order to activate 
      gear-based load-limiting.

      LLgear_table_rev2 Load-limit table selection for 2nd reverse gear 
      LLgear_tire Tire circumference used to calculate the gear ratio to 
      determine the current transmission gear. Parameter is only applicable when 
      "Gear-based load-limiting" is set to 'Enabled - Cal Based'. 
      LLTO_actv Indicates when the load-limit is actively being elevated by the 
      Load-Limit Temporary Override feature. 
      LLTO_hold_time The amount of time after VE CWT correction has fallen back 
      below the threshold during which the full value of the elevated load-limit 
      remains active. The hold period follows VE CWT dropping back below the 
      threshold and precedes the slewing down to the Speed-Based Load-Limit.

      A value of 0 seconds eliminates the hold time and causes the slewing down 
      to begin once VE CWT drops below the calibrated threshold. 
      LLTO_hold_tmr The amount of time remaining in the 'hold at elevated 
      load-limit' timer. 
      LLTO_multi_fuel_ena Select single load-limit override or fuel based 
      load-limit override 
      LLTO_pct The percent of the current Speed-Based Load-Limit which is added 
      to temporarily elevate the load-limit during a load dump transient. This 
      is only applied when "Load-limit override" is set to 'All Fuel Types' and 
      will not differentiate fuel types. The size of the load-limit elevation is 
      calculated once at the time the VE CWT correction % is exceeded (at the 
      onset of the transient).

      Example: if the Speed-Based Load-Limit is currently 80%, a 10% "Load-limit 
      override" will temporarily increase the Speed-Based Load-Limit to 88%.

      A value of 0% will disable the Load-Limit Temporary Override feature. 
      LLTO_pct_gsln Load-limit override percent for gasoline fuel type. 
      LLTO_pct_inc The current magnitude of the elevation of the load-limit. 
      LLTO_pct_LPG Load-limit override percent for LPG fuel type. 
      LLTO_pct_NG Load-limit override percent for NG fuel type. 
      LLTO_slew_rate The rate of change from the elevated load-limit to the 
      normal Speed-Based Load-Limit. 
      LLTO_state The current state of the Load-Limit Temporary Override feature. 

      LLTO_VE_CWT_crct_pct The threshold where the elevated load-limit is 
      triggered. 
      LoadLim_A_volts Target voltage for the 'Analog - A' selection for the 
      "Input config" parameter 
      LoadLim_B_volts Target voltage for the 'Analog - B' selection for the 
      "Input config" parameter

      include TSC1 load limits 
      LoadLim_eco_table If 'performance mode' is enabled and 'economy' is 
      commanded, this load-limiting table will be enforced. 
      LoadLim_ECT_tau This value specifies the time constant used for the 
      low-pass filter that is applied to the ECT-based load-limit speed 
      adjustment multiplier. 
      LoadLim_EGR_pct % load-limit, typically less than 100% if EGR_minnom_frac 
      < 0.0 
      LoadLim_ena Load-limit processing will use the calibration in the "Speed 
      Based Load-Limiting - Standard" section when this value is set to 'Enabled 
      - standard'. Calibration in the "Speed Based Load-Limiting - Expanded" 
      section will be ignored.

      Set this value to 'Enabled - enhanced' to allow load-limit processing to 
      use the calibration in the expanded section and ignore the calibration in 
      the standard section. 

      For diagnostic fault induced derate processing, this value is not required 
      to be enabled in either standard or expanded mode for Tables 1-16 to be 
      used as power derate 1/2 DBW limit sources. 
      LoadLim_gvauthTPSena If enabled, load and TPS limits apply to the current 
      governor maximum load authority and maximum TPS command.

      selection and the resulting active speed based load-limits are not fuel 
      specific. 
      LoadLim_T6_ntwk This parameter allows a CAN-based network selection mode 
      to be specified when table matching by a combination of fuel type and 
      selected mode is desired. To enable network selection mode, set this 
      parameter to one of the following values:

      LoadLim_T7_chan_cfg This parameter specifies either the active logic 
      state(s) or voltage-based selection for the analog or digital input 
      channel. For active logic state(s) evaluation, select 'Analog GND/+V' for 
      analog inputs and 'Default' or one of the DIG options for digital inputs. 
      For voltage-based selection, choose one of the three options: 'Analog - 
      A', 'Analog-B' or 'Analog-C'. Voltage-based selection is available for all 
      of the analog and digital input channels. 
      LoadLim_T7_fuel This parameter determines whether a table is evaluated for 
      a match during load-limit processing. A value of 'Disabled' removes a 
      table from load-limit processing regardless of the values for input 
      channel and network selection.

      If 'Gasoline', 'LPG', or 'NG' is selected, the current fuel type 
      determines whether the table is a match candidate. A value of 'All Fuels' 
      should only be used if matching based on input channel or network 
      selection and the resulting active speed based load-limits are not fuel 
      specific.

      - 'Standard': match based on receipt of a standard command. 
      LoadLim_Taux2_src This switch determines which temperature source is used 
      for auxiliary-temperature 2 based load-limiting. If this feature is not 
      requested, set this switch to 'Not Used' or set all table entries to 100%. 
      Note that the general 'Load-Limiting' enable switch must be set to 
      'Enabled' for this table to be activated. All other load-limiting tables 
      are also activated,so the lowest numerical value takes precedence. 
      LoadLim_Taux2_T Current value of selected auxiliary temperature 2 source. 
      LoadLim_Taux_src This switch determines which temperature source is used 
      for auxiliary-temperature 1 based load-limiting. If this feature is not 
      requested, set this switch to 'Not Used' or set all table entries to 100%. 
      Note that the general 'Load-Limiting' enable switch must be set to 
      'Enabled' for this table to be activated. All other load-limiting tables 
      are also activated,so the lowest numerical value takes precedence.

      For EGRT-based load-limiting, use the "Auxiliary-Temperature 2 Load Limit" 
      table. 
      LoadLim_Taux_T Current value of selected auxiliary temperature 1 source. 
      LoadLim_T_active Indicates the active speed based load limit table 
      load_cmd_pct Final (normalized) command load [0, 1] 
      load_est_type Switch: Determines the number iterations when computing the 
      desired MAP*VE product term (algorithm is iterative). This parameter was 
      more critical on the 3G Hardware due to the computational load requirement 
      on the microprocessor to execute The volumetric efficiency table can be 
      used or not, and depending on the complexity of the VE shape, more or less 
      iterations can be used. 
      local_cal_sync_CS_32 Localized calibration sync checksum 
      LOCKOFF2_pin This switch selects what output pin will control the 
      secondary gaseous fuel lockoff. This will mirror the normal lockoff 
      output. This setting should be disabled when not in use.

      Output channels that include a recirculation path should not be used with 
      a lockoff solenoid. 
      LOCKOFF3_pin When "Tri-Fuel mode" is enabled, this switch selects what 
      output pin will be used to control the second gaseous fuel primary lockoff 
      solenoid. This will be the fuel type NOT selected in the "Tri-Fuel mode 
      LOCKOFF output" setting.

      Output channels that include a recirculation path should not be used with 
      a lockoff solenoid. 
      LOCKOFF4_pin When "Tri-Fuel mode" is enabled, this switch selects what 
      output pin will control the second gaseous fuel secondary lockoff 
      solenoid. This will be the fuel type NOT selected in the "Tri-Fuel mode 
      LOCKOFF output" setting.

      Select 'Secondary lockoff pin' to use the same output pin as configured 
      for the "Secondary Gaseous lockoff enable pin" parameter. Because both 
      secondary lockoff solenoids on each gaseous fuel line are receiving the 
      same output signal with this setting, both solenoids will be held open 
      while the engine is running and gaseous fuel is flowing through one of the 
      lines. This setting does not affect lockoff control of the primary lockoff 
      solenoids in tri-fuel mode.

      This setting should be disabled when not in use. 

      Output channels that include a recirculation path should not be used with 
      a lockoff solenoid.

      LOCKOFF_flowwt This value determines how long a delay will be imposed 
      after the gaseous fuel lockoff is opened before fuel flow will be 
      commanded from the fuel metering devices. These may be either gaseous 
      injectors or an EPR device. A value of zero disables this feature.

      When the current fuel device is a CFV, a minimum value of 50ms will be 
      used for this delay if the entered value is lower. This substitution is 
      internal to the code – the (lower) entered value will still be shown in 
      the cell and will be used in the event of a fuel system change. 
      LOCKOFF_flt_err_rpt Determines when error (2) is reported instead of the 
      open/closed (1/0) state of the gaseous lockoff valve in the J1939 PGN 
      65433 SPN 65271. 

      If one of the following faults is historic latched:
      - Fuel run-out longer than expected
      - Fuel leak (regulator to mixer)

      Then this parameter determines when error is reported instead of the 
      open/closed state. There are 2 options:

      1) Historic latched and “Never Forget” is enabled for the fault
      2) Historic latched

      Error will always be reported when the fault is active latched. 
      LOCKOFF_hold_DC Specify the (possibly) reduced duty-cycle to use following 
      the lockoff hold wait period. The duty-cycle entered here is subject to 
      the following battery voltage correction:DC actual = DC calibration * 
      V_def / Vbatwhere V_def is the default battery voltage from the 
      'Estimators' tab. On I-EPR applications, only the primary lockoff utilizes 
      this feature. 
      LOCKOFF_hold_wait Specify the period of time to use 100% duty-cycle when 
      the lockoff initially opens. After this period of time, the (possibly) 
      reduced duty-cycle below is used to reduce heat dissipation. This value 
      must be <= 60.0 seconds. On I-EPR applications, only the primary lockoff 
      utilizes this feature. 
      LOCKOFF_hw_cfg Indicates if a LOCKOFF output pin is available in hardware 
      lockoff_keyoff_ena Closes the lock-off when "Key-off/on abs trigger" or 
      "Key-off rel trigger" conditions are met, without waiting for validation 
      times "Key-off abs validate" or "Key-off rel validate". 
      LOCKOFF_keyonwt This value determines how long a delay will be imposed 
      after key-on before the gaseous fuel lockoff is opened. A value of zero 
      disables this feature. 
      lockoff_key_wait This is the timeout value for a key-on engine-stopped 
      condition past which the gaseous fuel lockoff will be turned off. This 
      value must be <= to the key-on stopped wait general power timeout to be 
      meaningful since the power timeout will override the fuel supply disable 
      timeout if it is shorter. 
      LOCKOFF_LS_raw Lockoff output feedback (raw volts) 
      LOCKOFF_pin This switch selects what output pin will control the gaseous 
      fuel lockoff. The 'Standard' option means that the typical "named" pin on 
      the ECM will control this function. The 'Disabled' option means that no 
      output pin will be manipulated in response to a request to control this 
      device.

      Output channels that include a recirculation path should not be used with 
      a lockoff solenoid. 
      LOCKOFF_PWM_DC Lockoff PWM duty-cycle 
      LOCKOFF_PWM_manual Lockoff PWM manual control selection 
      LOCKOFF_wakeup Time required for the LP/NG lockoff solenoid to open. 
      LOD_flk_abort_Vbat Battery voltage drop threshold monitored during a fuel 
      leak (regulator to mixer) pressure test to detect starter engagement. If 
      this voltage drop is exceeded and the battery voltage derivative exceeds 
      its threshold, the fuel leak test is aborted. 
      LOD_flk_abort_Vbatdt Battery voltage derivative threshold in volts/sec 
      monitored during a fuel leak (regulator to mixer) pressure test to detect 
      starter engagement. If this value is exceeded and the battery voltage drop

      during a fuel leak test. If the engine does not reach 0 rpm within this 
      amount of time after shutdown, it will be forced to stop by closing the 
      lockoff, and the test will be aborted. 
      LOD_flk_spk_inh_cyc Number of crank cycles to inhibit spark for on next 
      engine start after completion of fuel leak test, if engine is still warm. 
      LOD_flk_spk_inh_ECT Engine coolant temp threshold required to cause spark

      test. 
      LOD_flk_WARN_force This switch controls the soft or hard warning output if 
      there is a historic fault stored for this lockoff diagnostic. If this 
      switch is set to other than 'Disabled', then that particular warning 
      output channel will be forced to an ON state continuously until the 
      historic fault is cleared by either a technician or the start-cycle 
      auto-clearing mechanism. 
      LOD_FROmax Time past key-off/lockoff-off when a fault will set during fuel 
      runout mode. 
      LOD_FRO_vehspd_max Maximum vehicle speed for evaluating the "Fuel run-out 
      longer than expected" diagnostic. The fuel run-out timer resets when the 
      vehicle speed exceeds this value. If set to 0, the maximum vehicle speed 
      condition is disabled. 
      LOD_min_ECT Minimum engine coolant temp that engine must exceed for the 
      specified time before lockoff leak diagnostics can run. 
      LOD_min_ECT_tm Time that engine coolant temp must exceed specified 
      threshold before lockoff leak diagnostics can run. 
      LOD_min_ECT_tmr Time above minimum ECT on current engine cycle. 
      LOD_slk_cyc_force Number of engine run cycles that must occur between

      leak test. 
      LOD_throt_lim Sets the maximum throttle position allowed while the fuel 
      leak diagnostic is running. 
      LOD_WARN_force This switch controls the soft or hard warning output if 
      there is a historic fault stored for this lockoff diagnostic. If this 
      switch is set to other than 'Disabled', then that particular warning 
      output channel will be forced to an ON state continuously until the 
      historic fault is cleared by either a technician or the start-cycle 
      auto-clearing mechanism.

      while the transmission is in 2nd gear in automatic mode. This is typically 
      a lower speed than the 1st gear governor limit.

      NOTE: In manual mode, the 2nd gear max governor limit is always used even 
      though the transmission may be in 1st gear. 
      M2TC_prrlim_nhyst After the occurrence of a 1st gear to 2nd gear engine 
      governor limit change, this hysteresis value will be subtracted from the 
      1st gear governor rpm limit to establish a switching point for reinstating 
      the 1st gear governor limit after downshifting back to 1st gear. 
      M2TC_prrshift_1G2 This is the speed at which an instant 1st to 2nd upshift 
      will occur. 
      M2TC_prrshift_2G1 This is the maximum speed allowed for a 2nd to 1st 
      downshift to occur. Neutral engagement is also required. 
      M2TC_retard_init During active torque-cut, this spark retard value will be 
      used. It is a positive retard value. 
      M2TC_ret_decay Following the active torque-cut duration, any spark retard 
      value present will be decayed back to zero at this rate. 
      M2TC_rpmlim This is the active max governor limit commanded by the 
      transmission control logic. 
      M2TC_timeshift_1G2 This is the amount of time to wait before initiating a 
      1st to 2nd upshift when the engine is above the 2nd gear governor speed. 
      MAF_cyl_events Enter the number of cylinder events to use for MAF 
      frequency measurement. Lower values result in faster sensor response, 
      higher values minimize the engine-related MAF pulsations. The max window 
      is limited to 200ms. Set this value to 0.0 to disable cylinder event based 
      windowing. 
      MAF_ena MAF sensor support is only for calibration purposes and is not 
      currently used in any of the ECM air flow computations. Note that not all 
      pulse/roadspeed inputs are capable of MAF measurement. The ECM PC display

      MAPdt_global_filt Parameter configures the filtering and calculation 
      method for the time derivative of MAP. When set to 'Default', the 
      derivative is calculated by interpolating MAP samples within the "MAPdt 
      interpolation window". When set to 'Cylinder Windowed', the derivative is 
      calculated from MAP_windowed. Refer to "MAP/TIP Cylinder Window 
      Calculation" section on the Inputs worksheet for configuring MAP 
      cylinder-event windowing.

      MAP_addtl_flt_react Enables additional fault reactions for specified MAP 
      faults. When any of the setting's specified faults are enabled and 
      faulted, the fuel calculation mode is automatically switched from 
      'Throttle-Model Based' to 'Speed-Density + dMAP/dt'. This is only 
      applicable to "Throttle-body injection fuel mode" and "CFV fuel 
      calculation mode".

      One or more of the faults below can be specified:
      "MAP higher than expected" fault
      "MAP pegging reference out-of-range" fault

      The "MAP high pressure" and "MAP low voltage" faults already switch the 
      fuel calculation mode when enabled and faulted.

      Note: This setting's fault reactions are in addition to any other 
      reactions, such as the fault switches on the 'Diagnostics' worksheet. 
      MAP_CADproject Number of CAD (in degrees) to project MAP value 
      MAP_def default MAP value 
      MAP_est Estimated value of MAP based on throttle model 
      MAP_est_step_size Parameter sets the integration time step size used when 
      calculating the throttle-model estimated MAP (MAP_est). The estimated 
      derivative of MAP (MAPdt_est) is numerically integrated using the 
      specified time step size. The default is 5 ms. A smaller time step can be 
      used to improve stability of the numerical integration. Below are the 
      enumerated step size values:
      0 = 5 ms (default)
      1 = 2.5 ms
      2 = 1.67 ms
      3 = 1.25 ms 
      MAP_favg_n MAP window filter size for fast fuel computations 
      MAP_fl_scaling TIP-based full load rescaling 
      MAP_fullload Full load MAP value at the current engine speed 
      MAP_fullload_BPlim For naturally aspirated applications, this parameter 
      determines how altitude compensation is applied to the engine-speed based 
      MAP full-load value from the "Engine No-Load/Full-Load Calibration" table. 
      If disabled, the MAP full-load table value, which is configured for 
      standard barometric pressure, is rescaled for the current barometric 
      pressure. 

      If enabled, the MAP full-load table value is only rescaled if it is above 
      the current barometric pressure. Adjustment is limited so that the minimum 
      rescaled MAP full-load value is the current barometric pressure. 
      MAP_global_filt This switch selects what type of general global filter 
      scheme is used for the MAP signal in most modes of operation. The 
      'Default' setting uses a combination of low-pass filtering and 
      time-averaging. The 'Cylinder Windowed' mode uses a sliding engine 
      synchronous window averaging technique. Refer to "MAP/TIP Cylinder Window 
      Calculation" section for configuration. Note that 'Throttle-Model Base 
      Throttle-Body Fueling' always uses cylinder windowing regardless of this 
      switch setting. 
      MAP_HiExp MAP higher than expected diagnostic: MAP-MAP estimate minimum 
      delta threshold 
      MAP_high_air MAP at high airflow point (psia at high airflow)

      MAP_max MAP high pressure diagnostic: MAP upper limit threshold 
      MAP_maxRPM MAP high pressure diagnostic: RPM lower limit entry condition 
      MAP_maxTPS MAP high pressure diagnostic: TPS upper limit entry condition 
      MAP_max_unlch MAP must drop below this value before the "MAP high 
      pressure" fault unlatches. When this parameter is set to 256 psia or 
      higher, ECM fault reactions (other than those controlled by fault 
      switches) will occur when the fault is active or latched. 
      MAP_MinKVflt Sets minimum MAP to run CD Spark < 5KV diagnostic fault. 
      MAP_minv MAP low voltage diagnostic: MAP voltage lower limit threshold

      MAP_minv_unlch MAP voltage (MAP_raw) must rise above this value before the 
      "MAP low voltage" fault unlatches. When this parameter is set to 0V, ECM 
      fault reactions (other than those controlled by fault switches) will occur 
      when the fault is active or latched.

      MAP_TIP_win_calc Parameter configures the calculation method for MAP and 
      TIP cylinder-event windowing. When set to 'Single Window', a window of 
      size "MAP/TIP cylinder window size primary" is used for calculating 
      MAP_windowed and TIP_windowed.

      When set to 'Dual Windows', two windows are used for calculating 
      MAP_windowed and TIP_windowed. The two windows consist of a primary window 
      of size "MAP/TIP cylinder window size primary" and a secondary window of 
      size "MAP/TIP cylinder window size secondary". The average of each window 
      contributes to the final windowed pressure value. The "MAP/TIP Dual 
      Windows" table determines the secondary window's contribution based on the 
      engine speed. For example, if the secondary contribution is 20% based on 
      the table, then the final windowed pressure value will be the summation of 
      80% of the primary window's average and 20% of the secondary window's 
      average. Dual windows are typically used to gradually switch between the 
      primary window's average at low engine speeds and the secondary window's 
      average at high engine speeds. 
      MAP_TIP_win_cyls This is the cylinder-window width of the engine 
      synchronous sliding window filter averaging technique used in some MAP and 
      TIP signal chains. For example - on a 8-cylinder engine - a value of 2.0 
      will average the MAP and TIP over a constant 180 CAD window. Note that 
      this value is always used for 'Throttle-Model Based Throttle-Body 
      Fueling'. 
      MAP_TIP_win_cyls2 This is the cylinder-window width for a secondary 
      MAP/TIP sliding window filter. Only applicable when "MAP/TIP cylinder 
      window calculation" is set to 'Dual Windows'. 
      MAP_windowed High speed cylinder event windowed MAP value

      the normal IAT analog input to calculate the MAT. Set this switch='IAT-CHT 
      based estimate' to use an IAT-CHT based estimate for the MAT. 
      MAT_est_tau MAT_tau is the low-pass filter time constant for the estimated 
      MAT value. The MAT will reach 63% of the estimated steady-state value 
      within MAT_tau seconds.

      maxgv_TSC_Gov3 This switch controls which THROTTLE governor gain settings 
      are used during remote speed limiting. Gov3 is always used during remote 
      speed command (setpoint) control, and the Max governor is always used 
      during remote speed limit control. However, the Max governor can be forced 
      to use Gov3 throttle governor settings during speed limiting using this 
      switch.

      MaxSetPt2_ena This switch controls the user max speed setpoint control 
      system. The AUX PUx selections allow Off=OPEN, RPM or Roadspeed 
      control=GROUND options. The AUX DIGx selections allow Off=OPEN, RPM 
      control=GROUND, Roadspeed control=+V options. The PU2 options with DIG2 
      qualification use the state of DIG2 at key-on and ignore it thereafter. 
      Engagement via PU2 is ignored on a Slave engine if the multi-engine sync 
      enable is set to 'PU2 on Slave'. 
      MaxSetPt_actvlt This switch determines what (if any) output is used to

      MaxSetPt_appdn_kph This is the vehicle speed window below the max vehicle 
      speed setpoint where blinking/pulsing the control indication light/output 
      can take place AFTER speed control initial engagement. Set this value to 
      zero to disable this function. The output indication will simply go from 
      full-on to full-off once the speed control releases if this function is 
      disabled. This parameter only applies if the system is in primary vehicle 
      speed mode. 
      MaxSetPt_appdn_rpm This is the rpm window below the max engine speed 
      setpoint where blinking/pulsing the control indication light/output can 
      take place AFTER speed control initial engagement. Set this value to zero 
      to disable this function. The output indication will simply go from 
      full-on to full-off once the speed control releases if this function is 
      disabled. This parameter only applies if the system is in primary engine 
      speed mode. 
      MaxSetPt_apprdt If the engine speed is above the target speed when the 
      system is initially engaged, the speed will be slewed down toward the 
      final setpoint at this rate (entered as a positive value). Set this value 
      to 9999 rpm/sec to disable this feature. 
      MaxSetPt_appup_kph This is the vehicle speed window below the max speed 
      setpoint where blinking/pulsing the control indication light/output can 
      take place PRIOR to speed control initial engagement. Set this value to 
      zero to disable this function. The output indication will simply go from 
      full-off to full-on once the speed control takes over if this function is 
      disabled. This parameter only applies if the system is in primary vehicle 
      speed mode. 
      MaxSetPt_appup_rpm This is the rpm window below the max engine speed 
      setpoint where blinking/pulsing the control indication light/output can

      (i.e. pulse-input / ZeroOff GPS / generic GPS). 
      MEFI_RS_source_req The currently requested roadspeed source from the 'MEFI 
      command packet'. This function is enabled by the switch above. 
      MEFI_sync_status If enabled, the cruise/sync status will be embedded in

      toward zero across the phase-in speed. 
      MES_auth_pos This is the sync closed-loop speed modifier total positive 
      authority limit (must always be a positive number). It will be attenuated 
      toward zero across the phase-in speed. 
      MES_ena This controls what input source (if any) allows the multi-engine 
      speed sync function to be activated. On tri-state inputs (such as the Aux 
      DIG inputs), any state other than open will engage sync. 
      MES_FPPdelt_0 When the MES system is in 'Lever Match' or 'FPP-Match' mode, 
      this is the +/- tolerance between the master and slave levers that cause 
      0% engagement (complete disengagement) of engine speed sync. Between this 
      value and the 100% engagement value, there will be a linear attenuation of 
      the authority of the engine speed sync. This value should always be >= the 
      100% engagement value. 
      MES_FPPdelt_1 When the MES system is in 'Lever Match' or 'FPP-Match' mode, 
      this is the +/- tolerance between the master and slave levers that cause 
      100% engagement of engine speed sync. It is also a requirement that all 
      connected engines be in forward gear for this engagement to occur. 
      MES_FPP_cmd Multi-engine speed synchronization: MES sync (slave) FPP 
      command 
      MES_FPP_mode This switch controls the type of engine sync mode that the 
      engine will be in when 'FPP' or lever operation mode is selected (as 
      opposed to syn'd RPM user setpoint mode). 'Master Lever' mode is also 
      known as single-lever control, and this mode uses the slave FPP as the max 
      authority for the slave engine. 'Lever Match' mode only initiates sync 
      when the slave FPP matches the master FPP within the defined tolerances. 
      MES_FPP_mstr Multi-engine speed synchronization: MES master FPP command 
      MES_FPP_ntrlock Sync FPP command at the time of sync disengagement.

      the engine-sync function. Only the following gains are used: Kp, Ki, Kd, 
      Kiv, Kp_dz, Ki_dz, Kd_dz. Note that the 'droop' and 'isochronous' 
      designations do not actually cause different governor behaviors. 
      MES_Iacc Currently speed sync integrator value 
      MES_Ilim_neg This is the sync integrator negative authority limit (must 
      always be a negative number). It will be attenuated toward zero across the 
      phase-in speed.

      The master TPS command is still fed through directly to the slave without 
      delay. 
      MES_rpmdelt_0 This is the delta rpm from the current idle target above 
      which speed sync will begin to engage. 
      MES_rpmdelt_1 This is the delta rpm from the initiation speed over which 
      speed sync will be fully engaged. This is a linear phase-in from 0% to 
      100% engagement.

      MES_state Current state of the speed sync system. 
      MES_status Multi-engine speed synchronization: MES sync engagement (Master 
      or slave / Master only) 
      MES_status_lamp This switch optionally configures an output on the master 
      engine to indicate when all connected slaves are within the defined RPM 
      tolerance band to indicate sync achieved. 
      MES_status_mstr Multi-engine speed synchronization: MES sync communicated 
      status - This switch controls the J1939 communicated multi-engine symc 
      status. If set to "Master Only", slave engines will communicate 'Not 
      Available' for multi-engine sync status. 
      MES_status_rpmtol This is the +/- rpm speed difference between the 
      currently commanded master engine sync speed and any slave to validate the 
      sync achieved status indication. 
      MES_sw_source Multi-engine speed synchronization: MES switch source

      MES_usblk_offt When engine sync is commanded but the engines speeds do not 
      match by the specified indication tolerance, the sync indication 
      light/output will blink with the given on-time and off-time. The blink 
      total period is the sum of these two values, and the duty-cycle can be 
      modified using asymmetry. 
      MES_usblk_ont When engine sync is commanded but the engines speeds do not 
      match by the specified indication tolerance, the sync indication 
      light/output will blink with the given on-time and off-time. The blink 
      total period is the sum of these two values, and the duty-cycle can be 
      modified using asymmetry. 
      MES_WOTds_0 At this absolute FPP position on each slave engine, the WOT 
      de-sync feature will be completed (fully de-sync'd) if the software switch 
      above is enabled. Therefore, the phase-in value will linearly decrease 
      from 100% to 0% as the FPP position increases toward this completion value 
      from the initiation value. 
      MES_WOTds_1 At this absolute FPP position on each slave engine, the WOT 
      de-sync feature will initiate if the software switch above is enabled. 
      Therefore, the phase-in value will linearly decrease from 100% to 0% as 
      the FPP position increases toward the completion value. 
      MES_WOT_desync This switch allows a sync'd set of master/slave engines to 
      de-synchronize at wide-open-throttle (WOT) conditions in order to take 
      advantage of the maximum power of each engine individually. This de-sync 
      will begin at the smaller absolute FPP value below, and complete a full 
      phase-out of synchronization at the larger absolute FPP value below. 
      ME_DERATE1_active Multi-engine Derate1 
      ME_DERATE2_active Multi-engine Derate2 
      ME_derate_ena If this switch is 'Enabled' and multi-engine communications 
      are active over the CAN link with the proprietary engine-to-engine 
      transmit packet PGN '61184', then a derate on another engine will cause 
      all engines to derate temporarily (until unlatched by driver throttle 
      interaction as defined above for 'Derate release'). 
      ME_derate_resett This is the time that must expire once an engine has 
      de-rated itself and then unlatched the derate due to another engine derate 
      in a multi-engine configuration before re-arming derates from another 
      engine. Set this value to zero to immediately re-arm, and set this value 
      to > 60.0 seconds to permanently keep from re-arming.

      MFA_DSPressdt "Switch used to enable transmission of specific high-speed 
      data from the device to the ECU. The transmission of the actual throttle 
      position and actual mass flow are always performed at high speed. 
      Additionally, transmission of pressure and temperature values always 
      transmitted but typically at a slower speed. 

      This setting enables the transmission of an additional CAN packet from the 
      device to the ECU at a high speed that contains the following data:

      - Fast-filtered downstream pressure
      - Slow-filtered downstream pressure
      - Downstream pressure dt
      - Fast-filtered upstream pressure

      The following options are provided:
      - Disabled – High speed data transmission is disabled

      - Enabled – High speed data transmission is enabled

      - Automatic – High speed data transmission is enabled if the data is used 
      as the source for a standard ECU input. (No ECU inputs currently make use 
      of MFG high speed data so this setting will result in high speed data 
      transmission from the MFG being disabled)."

      scale (MFA_mdot_FS). 
      MFA_mdot_FS This is the full-scale mass flow rate in g/sec used for a MFA 
      throttle. Mixture flows are transmitted as a % of this value in order to 
      properly scale the dynamic range of the valve. This should be set to a 
      value slightly higher than the maximum expected flow rate through the

      This value is provided to and enforced by the MFA device. The default is 0 
      %. 
      MFA_TPS_cmd_pct MFA commanded throttle position %. 
      MFA_TPS_dP_min Minimum delta pressure enforced by the MFA used to 
      calculate a maximum TPS to prevent a zero delta pressure condition across 
      the throttle valve. 
      MFA_USPress MFA upstream pressure 
      MFA_VE_mdot_err MFA flow error percentage calculated based on the 
      difference between the MFA actual mass flow and the estimated

      - Standard Input – Specifies a MAP sensor connected directly to the MAP 
      input on the ECU. This is the default option.

      - MFA over CAN – Specifies the MAP value(s) will be obtained from an MFA 
      device over the CAN network. Use of this option requires an MFA to be 
      present and enabled on the system. The “MFA high speed data tx enabled” 
      (MFA_hsdata_tx_ena) setting on the “DBW” worksheet should be configured as

      "MFG flow lower than expected" and "MFG flow higher than expected" 
      diagnostics. 
      MFG_FTemp MFG fuel temperature 
      MFG_fuel_calc Specifies the method used to calculate the fuel mass flow 
      command for the MFG.

      - “Speed-Density + dMAP/dt” – uses VE-based speed density computations 
      along with the “MFG location” setting and closed-loop correction to 
      determine the appropriate desired fuel.

      - "Throttle-Model Based" - used the throttle model to compute required 
      fuel flow.

      - “MFA mass flow” – uses the actual mixture mass flow calculated by the 
      MFA and closed-loop correction to determine the appropriate desired fuel. 
      This option requires an MFA to be present and enabled on the system. 
      MFG_hi_flow_pct Flow error percentage threshold fault condition for the 
      "MFG flow higher than expected" diagnostic. 
      MFG_hsdata_active Indicates if high speed data packets are being received 
      from the MFG. 
      MFG_hsdata_tx_act Slow-filtered downstream pressure reported by the MFG. 
      MFG_hsdata_tx_ena Switch used to enable transmission of specific 
      high-speed data from the device to the ECU. The transmission of the actual 
      throttle position and actual mass flow are always performed at high speed. 
      Additionally, transmission of pressure and temperature values always 
      transmitted but typically at a slower speed.

      This setting enables the transmission of an additional CAN packet from the 
      device to the ECU at a high speed that contains the following data:

      - Fast-filtered downstream pressure
      - Slow-filtered downstream pressure
      - Downstream pressure dt
      - Fast-filtered upstream pressure

      The following options are provided:
      - Disabled – High speed data transmission is disabled

      - Enabled – High speed data transmission is enabled

      - Automatic – High speed data transmission is enabled if the data is used 
      as the source for a standard ECU input. (No ECU inputs currently make use 
      of MFG high speed data so this setting will result in high speed data 
      transmission from the MFG being disabled). 
      MFG_hsd_comm_tout Timeout value for MFG high speed data comm timeout 
      fault. 
      MFG_loc Specifies the location of the MFG in the intake track.

      - “Air filter” – the MFG is operating in a draw-through environment and is 
      located between the air filter and the throttle in a naturally aspirated 
      system or between the air filter and the compressor in a boosted system.

      - “Pre-throttle” – the MFG is operating in a boosted environment and is 
      located between the compressor and the throttle. 
      MFG_lo_flow_pct Flow error percentage threshold fault condition for the 
      "MFG flow lower than expected" diagnostic. 
      MFG_man_mode Controls the active MFG mode. Allows selection of either 
      automatic control or one of the manual modes. 
      MFG_mdot_act MFG reported mdot fuel flow. 
      MFG_mdot_act_pct MFG reported mdot fuel flow percentage of MFG Full scale 
      (MFG_mdot_FS). 
      MFG_mdot_choke After-start fuel enrichment contribution to the MFG fuel 
      flow command. 
      MFG_mdot_cmd MFG commanded mdot fuel flow. 
      MFG_mdot_cmd_pct MFG commanded mdot fuel flow percentage of MFG Full scale 
      (MFG_mdot_FS). 
      MFG_mdot_cmd_tau Low-pass applied to the mass flow fuel command 
      transmitted to the MFG. Set this value to 0 to disable the low-pass. 
      MFG_mdot_FS This is the full-scale fuel mass flow rate in g/sec used for a 
      MFG based fueling. Fuel flow commands are transmitted as a % of this value 
      in order to properly scale the dynamic range of the valve. A typical value 
      of 32.0 g/sec will satisfy all installations up to approximately 600 bhp. 
      MFG_mdot_mult MFG mass flow fuel command multiplier that may be used to 
      adjust the final fuel command provided to the device. By default, the 
      multiplier is set to 1.000 (no adjustment). 
      MFG_MFA_mdot_cmd MFA-based fueling command used if the MFG fueling mode is 
      configured for MFA-based. 
      MFG_param_differ MFG internal parameter match status indicating if all 
      parameters match or if at least one does not match. 
      MFG_param_NA_cnt The MFG ParamOCAN index not available counter for either 
      timed-out or N/A index response ParamOCAN requests. 
      MFG_param_upload Used to force parameter upload from the MFG to the ECM. 
      MFG_RLV_cyc_elapsed Number of warm engine cycles since the last execution 
      of the CFV/MFG redundant lockoff verification fuel run-out test. 
      MFG_RLV_ena If enabled, MFG applications will verify the operation of the 
      secondary lockoff device when the number of warm engine cycles specified 
      for the 'MFG RLV test failed' diagnostic have occurred since the previous 
      execution of the test.

      The test starts when the key is turned off or a remote engine stop command 
      is received. Fuel run-out is engaged and only the secondary lockoff device 
      is closed. The test is successful if the engine stops before the fuel 
      run-out engine run time threshold calibrated for the 'MFG RLV test failed' 
      diagnostic is exceeded. The test fails if that diagnostic becomes 
      active-latched.

      For all other engine cycles in which the secondary lockoff verification 
      test is not active, only the primary lockoff is closed for engine stop 
      requests.

      In addition to setting this parameter to "Enabled", the following 
      calibration is required to enable the MFG redundant lockoff verification 
      mode: 
      - active fuel device: MFG
      - fuel type: NG and/or LPG
      - 'MFG RLV test failed' diagnostic: enabled
      - secondary gaseous lockoff enable pin: set to a valid output pin

      If tri-fuel mode is enabled, MFG applications will also verify the 
      operation of the tri-fuel secondary lockoff device if installed on the 
      second gaseous fuel line using the same fuel-run out procedure and 'MFG 
      RLV test failed' diagnostic as described above. Tri-fuel secondary lockoff 
      verification will occur every other drive cycle if the second gaseous fuel 
      is the active fuel type when the key if turned off or a remote engine stop 
      command is received. 

      MFG_RLV_eng_cyc Number of warm engine cycles between executions of the 
      CFV/MFG redundant lockoff verification fuel run-out test. 

      If tri-fuel mode is enabled, this threshold only affects which drive cycle 
      the CFV/MFG redundant lockoff test is executed on the secondary lockoff 
      solenoid for the first gaseous fuel designated by the "Tri-Fuel mode 
      LOCKOFF output" parameter on the Miscellaneous worksheet. When the second 
      gaseous fuel is the active fuel type, the CFV/MFG redundant lockoff test 
      is executed for the tri-fuel secondary lockoff solenoid every other drive 
      cycle. 
      MFG_RLV_FROmax At key-off when the CFV/MFG RLV fuel run-out test is 
      active, fuel run-out is engaged and the secondary lockoff is closed. If 
      the engine does not stop prior to exceeding this time threshold, the 'CFV 
      RLV test failed' (CFV applications) or 'MFG RLV test failed' (MFG 
      applications) fault will set. 
      MFG_RLV_FROWARNforce This switch controls the soft or hard warning output 
      if there is a historic fault stored for this lockoff diagnostic. If this 
      switch is set to other than 'Disabled', then that particular warning 
      output channel will be forced to an ON state continuously until the 
      historic fault is cleared by either a technician or the startcycle 
      autoclearing mechanism. 
      MFG_RLV_FRO_RS_ena Enables the "Fuel run-out longer than expected" fault 
      road speed condition for the “CFV RLV test failed” and “MFG RLV test 
      failed” faults. 
      MFG_RLV_HM_elapsed Number of engine hours since the last execution of the 
      CFV/MFG redundant lockoff verification fuel run-out test. 
      MFG_RLV_run_force Number of engine hours between executions of the CFV/MFG 
      redundant lockoff verification fuel run-out test. 
      MFG_RLV_state CFV/MFG redundant lockoff verification (RLV) fuel run-out 
      test state. When a test is active, this field will display which of the 
      four lockoff devices is undergoing verification. 
      MFG_SD_mdot_cmd Speed density-based fueling command used if the MFG 
      fueling mode is configured for speed density. 
      MFG_status The overall status of the MFG. 
      MFG_TPS_act_pct MFG actual throttle position %. 
      MFG_TPS_cmd_max The maximum throttle position percent limit. This limit is 
      enforced when operating in position or flow mode. 

      This value is especially useful to limit to a reasonable TPS when using a 
      device that is oversized for an engine.

      This value is provided to and enforced by the MFG. The default is 100 %. 
      MFG_TPS_cmd_min The minimum throttle position percent limit. This limit is 
      enforced when operating in position or flow mode. This position is not 
      enforced when the motor is commanded off. The return spring will return 
      the blade to 0 % in this case.

      This value is provided to and enforced by the MFG device. The default is 0 
      %. 
      MFG_TPS_cmd_pct MFG commanded throttle position %. 
      MFG_USPress MFG upstream pressure 
      MFG_VE_mdot_err MFG flow error percentage calculated based on the 
      difference between the MFG actual mass flow and the commanded 
      speed-density based mass flow. This flow error is compared to the 
      calibrated flow error percentage threshold for "MFG flow lower than 
      expected" and "MFG flow higher than expected" diagnostic processing. 
      mfi_ena Multi-function input 
      mfi_func_allowed Current function 
      mfi_idle_ena When enabled the multi-function input control will support 
      idle trim when the vehicle is stopped and the brake is depressed. 
      mfi_pto_ena When enabled the multi-function input control will support 
      power take-off enabling/disabling and increment/decrement. If the 
      "Governor application mode" is set to 'Vehicle, neutral required if 
      stationary', then the PTO function is enabled whenever conditions are not 
      valid for selecting the roadspeed cruise or idle trim function. If the 
      "Governor application mode" is set to 'Vehicle, neutral required', then 
      the PTO function is enabled when the vehicle is stopped, the transmission 
      is in neutral, and the brake is not depressed. 
      mfi_rsc_ena When enabled the multi-function input control will support 
      roadspeed cruise control enabling/disabling and increment/decrement when 
      the vehicle is moving. If the "Governor application mode" is set to 
      "Vehicle, neutral required if stationary", then the minimum roadspeed for 
      enabling cruise control function is the roadspeed cruise minimum speed; 
      otherwise, the minimum roadspeed is 0.5 kph. 
      MHGL_active logical indicating that the gear lockout button has been 
      pressed and EES.MHGL_latched is ready to latch gear lockout 
      MHGL_chan For marine throttle & gear handles, this selection allows for 
      the connection of a momentary push button to implement transmission gear 
      lockout (or neutral lock) functionality.
      If the button is depressed when the handle is in the neutral (vertical) 
      position, the handle can then be moved forward/backward without causing a 
      shift to forward/reverse.
      The button can be released once the handle is moved into the normal gear 
      engagement region and the gear lockout will remain latched. 
      MHGL_chan_cfg This setting determines the active state of the button used 
      for the gear lockout function described above. 
      MHGL_lamp This output channel allows a light/lamp to be illuminated once 
      the gear lockout function described above is latched. Illumination of this 
      lamp indicates that the momentary gear lockout button can be released as 
      long as the handle remains in a normal gear engagement region. 
      MHGL_latched logical YES/NO indicating that the marine handle gear lockout 
      (MHGL) button request has been validated and latched 
      MHGL_unlatch_tout Once the gear lockout function described above is 
      latched in a normal gear engagement region, this is the unlatch wait time 
      imposed after the handle is returned to neutral. 
      MILblk_btw_codes Fault shutdown inhibit input - Selects the input used for 
      fault shutdown inhibit. When this input is active, it prevents any fault 
      from being able to shut down the engine. 
      MILblk_btw_digits Flash Code Blink Configuration: Time between digits in a 
      code 
      MILblk_btw_repeat Flash Code Blink Configuration: Extra time between code 
      repeats 
      MILblk_code_rpt Flash Code Blink Configuration: Number of times to repeat 
      a code 
      MILblk_code_strt_max Maximum number of cycles to blink a flash code for a 
      historic fault. If set to 0, a flash code will blink until the fault 
      clears. 
      MILblk_derate Flash Code Blink Configuration: Power derate MIL blink 
      enable switch 
      MILblk_digit_off Flash Code Blink Configuration: Blink off-time 
      MILblk_digit_on Flash Code Blink Configuration: Blink on-time 
      MILblk_input_moment Flash Code Blink Configuration: Blink sequence input 
      switch type (toggle switch vs. momentary switch) 
      MILblk_off An active fault may cause a continuous MIL output activation or 
      a blinking/pulsing MIL output. The on/off times specify this behavior. For 
      a continuously on output in an active state, simply set the offtime to 
      zero and the ontime to any value. 
      MILblk_on An active fault may cause a continuous MIL output activation or 
      a blinking/pulsing MIL output. The on/off times specify this behavior. For 
      a continuously on output in an active state, simply set the offtime to 
      zero and the ontime to any value. 
      MILblk_open_ini MIL open-output transfer: Blink/Pulse Initial time - This 
      is the initial blink/pulse on-time that will be used for the first pulse 
      following an open-output transfer to another channel. 
      MILblk_open_off MIL open-output transfer: Blink/Pulse Off-Time 
      configuration (ms) 
      MILblk_open_on MIL open-output transfer: Blink/Pulse On-Time configuration 
      (ms) 
      MILblk_series_wait Flash Code Blink Configuration: Extra time before 
      starting codes over 
      MILblk_start_wait Flash Code Blink Configuration: Delay before start of 
      code blinking 
      MILblk_trigger_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG9 = Gnd
      Aux DIG10 = Gnd
      Aux DIG11 = Gnd
      Aux DIG12 = Gnd
      Aux DIG13 = Gnd
      Aux DIG14 = Gnd
      Aux DIG15 = Gnd
      Aux DIG16 = Gnd
      Aux DIG17 = Gnd
      Aux DIG18 = Gnd
      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      MILblk_trigger_ena Select the ECM input that will trigger a blink 
      sequence. The 'Default' option looks for a grounded RS-232 Rx line on ECMs 
      that support RS-232. For ECMs without RS-232 support (the majority of 4G 
      variants DO NOT support RS-232), the 'Default' option disables flash code 
      blinking. Flash code blinking will only occur when the selected input is 
      grounded during an engine-stopped key-on situation. 
      MILchan_open This switch controls which output pin will be actuated when 
      the MIL s triggered and the normal MIL output is detected to be open. If 
      the MIL, soft, and hard warning channels are set or transferred to the 
      same output, MIL functionality receives the highest priority and soft 
      warning functionality receives the lowest priority. 
      MILout_mirror MIL output pin 
      MILpdfb_off Power Derate Mode MIL Fast-blink Configuration: Fast-blink 
      off-time 
      MILpdfb_on Power Derate Mode MIL Fast-blink Configuration: Fast-blink 
      on-time 
      MILst_off Key-on, Engine-off Stored Fault Blink Configuration: Blink 
      off-time 
      MILst_on Key-on, Engine-off Stored Fault Blink Configuration: Blink 
      on-time 
      MIL_DM1_output Sets DM1 lamps bit configuration. "Legacy" sends ON or OFF 
      only. "Euro VI Discriminatory MIL" sends MIL status based on Euro VI 
      dsicriminatory MIL states which allows blinking of the MIL. 
      MIL_LS_raw MIL output low-side voltage diagnostic input 
      MIL_off_loVf MIL open diagnostic: Low-side feedback lower limit threshold 
      MIL_on_hiVf MIL control short to power diagnostic: Low-side feedback upper 
      limit threshold 
      MIL_output_chan This switch controls which output pin will be actuated 
      when the MIL is triggered. The MIL output channel needs to be distinct 
      from the soft and hard warning output channels, as there is no priority 
      scheme in place to handle conflicts between these channel assignments when 
      a MIL output open condition is not present. 
      MIL_persist_min Minimum ON-time for the following indicators:
      - MIL (FSF_MIL_STATE, MIL_persist_tmr)
      - Soft warning (flag1_SWARN)
      - Hard warning (flag1_HWARN)
      - Derate 1 (DERATE1_active)
      - Derate 2 (DERATE2_active)
      - NOx derate (DERATE_NOx_active)
      - Low rev limit (LOWREVLIM_active)
      Once condition clears, the indicator will continue to persist for this 
      amount of time. Minimum value is 0.050 seconds. 
      MIL_persist_tmr MIL persistence timer 
      MIL_start_cnt MIL persistence engine start counter 
      MIL_start_cnt_min This value determines MIL illumination behavior after an 
      active fault has gone inactive. If it is set to zero, then the MIL will 
      extinguish as soon as the fault goes inactive (subject to the minimum 
      active on-time above).

      If it is set to a value > 0 then the MIL will be continuously illuminated 
      in this many subsequent engine start cycles even if the fault does not 
      reactivate. For example, a value of 1 will only cause the MIL to stay on 
      during the current engine run cycle in which the fault went active. A 
      value of 4 will cause the MIL to stay on during the current run cycle and 
      3 subsequent engine start cycles.

      If the "Fault system mode" is configured as 'Euro VI' or 'CARB 1971.1' 
      this setting is ignored. The MIL behavior will instead be determined by 
      the applicable legislation requirements.

      For 'Custom' and 'State Standard V (SSV)' fault system modes, this setting 
      is also ignored if "Fault action persist MIL" is enabled. Instead, the 
      fault action persist configuration will determine MIL illumination 
      behavior for all faults with the "Action Persist" fault switch selected. 
      For all other faults, a zero value for this parameter is enforced. 
      MIL_start_cnt_mina Actual/effective MIL_start_cnt_min value. May be 
      adjusted from desired base on active fault system mode.

      MMSD_ena This switch controls the engine spin-down minimum and maximum MAP 
      control function. This function will manage a DBW throttle to maintain an 
      approximate MAP following a key-off/engine-running condition as the engine 
      comes to a stop (spin-down).

      Minimum MAP can be used to limit MAP to a minimum value, such as baro, to 
      release vacuum through the engine and exhaust.

      Maximum MAP can be used to set a MAP maximum value, such as MAP near idle, 
      for smoother spin-down. 'Max MAP – filtered idle' will initialize the MAP 
      target to the single point target and will low-pass filter the target 
      while the engine is running, the FPP indicates idle, and engine speed is 
      within 200 RPM of the ECT-based idle.

      NOTE: this control will only remain active until the 'Underspeed' rpm 
      threshold is reached. To keep this control active longer on spin-down, 
      lower the 'Underspeed' parameter. 
      MMSD_maxMAP If 'Max MAP - filtered idle' is selected, this is the current 
      value for the filtered idle MAP target. 
      MMSD_maxTPS This value will be the maximum TPS used during active engine 
      spin-down MAP control. 
      MMSD_MinMAP This value will be the minimum or maximum (single point) MAP 
      target used during engine spin-down. For 'Max MAP – filtered idle', this 
      value will be the initial value which is then low-pass filtered during 
      idle conditions when the engine is running.

      NOTE: this is only an approximate value since no closed-loop MAP control 
      using the actual MAP is used. The MAP target is used to select TPS, and 
      the learned min/max TPS values will be reset to their defaults during 
      spin-down. 
      MMSD_minTPS This value will be the minimum TPS used during active engine 
      spin-down MAP control. 
      MMSD_TPS_pct If MMSD_active is active (MAP spin down control), this is the 
      target TPS setting

      MSP_rampRS_final When either increase or decrease button is held down, 
      this is the final full roadspeed increase ramp-rate that will be achieved 
      following the initial delay and the phase-in time. 
      MSP_ramp_delay This switch controls the user max speed setpoint control 
      system. The AUX PUx selections allow Off=OPEN, RPM or Roadspeed 
      control=GROUND options. The AUX DIGx selections allow Off=OPEN, RPM 
      control=GROUND, Roadspeed control=+V options. The PU2 options with DIG2 
      qualification use the state of DIG2 at key-on and ignore it thereafter.
      Engagement via PU2 is ignored on a Slave engine if the multi-engine sync 
      enable is set to 'PU2 on Slave'. 
      MSP_ramp_final When either increase or decrease button is held down, this 
      is the final full RPM increase ramp-rate that will be achieved following 
      the initial delay and the phase-in time. 
      MSP_ramp_phase When either increase or decrease button is held down, this 
      is the amount of time (following the delay time) during which the speed 
      ramp rate will be increased from zero to the full ramp rate value. 
      MSP_setclr_HW_input This selection determines the source for the set/clear 
      function of the user setpoint max speed system. 
      MSP_setclr_sw Set/Clear software switch

      m_d_cmd_TD_tau Decreases in diluent commands are accepted immediately 
      without filtering or slewing. With low-pressure EGR applications, 
      reductions in diluent commands are filtered using this time constant in 
      order to more accurately represent the actual diluent flow and help reduce 
      fueling errors. This value is ignored in high-pressure EGR applications, 
      since CFV fueling is based on EGR feedback. Set this to 0 to disable this 
      filter. Typically, a value of 50-100ms yields good results.

      OCT_adapt The current fuel octane indication. 0% indicates lowoctane (base 
      spark table), and 100% indicates hi octane (alternate spark table). 
      OCT_adapt_ena Selects enable/disable of the adaptive octane function. 
      Inherently selects the 'high' octane table when enabled - the base table 
      for the current fuel becomes the 'low' octane table. 
      OCT_adapt_fault_mode Specifies how adaptive octane should react while a 
      MAP, ECT, or IAT fault is active or latched.

      When "Set to 0%" is selected (the default), the octane rating will be set 
      to 0%. This is the recommended setting for gasoline engines.

      When "Use last value" is selected, the octane rating will not update. This 
      is the recommended setting for gaseous fuel types. 
      OCT_adapt_reset Resets the octane rating and increasing slew rate to 
      power-up default values. 
      OCT_dec_knkpctinc_dz Minimum increasing change in knock retard to trigger 
      an octane rating decrease, as a percentage of the knock retard gain.

      If set to 100%, the derivative-based decrease is disabled. 
      OCT_dec_tm Octane rating decrease window duration for responding to a 
      knock retard increase. 
      OCT_ECT_ena Octane estimation will be locked-out for ECT temperatures 
      below this value. 
      OCT_gsln_alt_tbl Alternate spark table which will be adapted towards when 
      adaptive octane is active and running on gasoline fuel 
      OCT_gsln_ena Type of octane to adapt to when running on gasoline fuel. 
      OCT_inc_tmr Current octane increase wait timer value to be compared with 
      the wait time value below. 
      OCT_inc_wait If an increase in octane is indicated and ready, this is the 
      amount of time that must elapse from the last knock event (activity) of a 
      magnitude greater than 'OCT_inc_wait_pct' below before octane will adapt 
      in the increasing direction. Set to zero to disable this feature. 
      OCT_inc_wait_pct This is the instantaneous knock activity threshold below 
      which the octane increase timer will begin incrementing. See the 
      description of the wait time above for more information. 
      OCT_init On power-up from loss of battery, the ECM will load this value as 
      the initial octane rating. 0% indicates initial low-octane (base spark 
      table), and 100% indicates initial hi-octane (alternate spark table). 
      OCT_init_mode This switch controls the way that the octane rating is 
      initialized on key-up. 'Use last value' uses the value from when the 
      engine last shut down. 'Reset to default' always resets to the cold 
      power-up default. 
      OCT_init_table This value selects either a scalar based initialization 
      strategy (using the cold power-up default octane rating) or a table based 
      initialization strategy (using the adaptive octane table below). 
      OCT_learning Logical indicating conditions are valid for updating the 
      octane rating. 
      OCT_LP_alt_tbl Alternate spark table which will be adapted towards when 
      adaptive octane is active and running on LP fuel. 
      OCT_LP_ena Type of octane to adapt to when running on LP fuel. 
      OCT_MAPss This is the lowpass filtered version of the MAP used to generate 
      a 'steady state' MAP estimate. This 'steady state' value is compared to 
      the instantaneous MAP to determine if the engine is within a steady state 
      window for octane adaptive estimation validation. 
      OCT_MAPss_win The octane adaptation low-pass (steady-state) MAP must match 
      the instantaneous MAP within a +/- window of this size to validate octane 
      adaptation. 
      OCT_max_MAP Octane estimation will be locked-out for MAP or MAP load 
      pressures above this value. 
      OCT_max_RPM Octane estimation will be locked-out for RPM speeds above this 
      value. 
      OCT_mem_type This switch selects either a single-point adaptive octane 
      value, or a table-based adaptive strategy. 
      OCT_min_MAP Octane estimation will be locked-out for MAP or MAP load 
      pressures below this value. 
      OCT_min_RPM Octane estimation will be locked-out for RPM speeds below this 
      value. 
      OCT_NG_alt_tbl Alternate spark table which will be adapted towards when 
      adaptive octane is active and running on NG fuel. 
      OCT_NG_ena Type of octane to adapt to when running on NG fuel. 
      OCT_phi_ena Selects enable/disable of octane based phi interpolation 
      strategy. Inherently selects the 'high' octane phi table when enabled. The 
      base table for the current fuel becomes the 'low' octane phi table. If 
      this feature is enabled, it should generally be set to the same high 
      octane fuel type table as the normal adaptive octane enable switch to 
      avoid confusion. 
      OCT_phi_gsln_alt_tbl Alternate fuel table which will be adapted towards 
      when adaptive octane based phi is enabled and running on gasoline fuel. 
      OCT_phi_gsln_ena Enables or disables octane based phi adaption when 
      running on gasoline fuel. 
      OCT_phi_LP_alt_tbl Alternate fuel table which will be adapted towards when 
      adaptive octane based phi is enabled and running on LP fuel. 
      OCT_phi_LP_ena Enables or disables octane based phi adaption when running 
      on LP fuel. 
      OCT_phi_NG_alt_tbl Alternate fuel table which will be adapted towards when 
      adaptive octane based phi is enabled and running on NG fuel. 
      OCT_phi_NG_ena Enables or disables octane based phi adaption when running 
      on NG fuel. 
      OCT_ret_decrease Knock retard values above this will cause the octane 
      rating to decrease at a rate proportional to the current knock retard, 
      once validation conditions are satisfied.

      If set to a value above the maximum knock retard, the proportional 
      decrease is disabled. 
      OCT_ret_increase Knock retard values below this will cause the octane 
      rating to increase once validation conditions are satisfied. 
      OCT_RPMss This is the lowpass filtered version of the RPM used to generate 
      a 'steadystate' RPM estimate. This 'steadystate' value is compared to the 
      instantaneous RPM to determine if the engine is within a steadystate 
      window for octane adaptive estimation validation. 
      OCT_RPMss_win The octane adaptation low-pass (steady-state) RPM must match 
      the instantaneous RPM within a +/- window of this size to validate octane 
      adaptation. 
      OCT_run_wait Octane estimation will be locked-out for this amount of time 
      after engine start to allow engine stabilization. 
      OCT_slew_dec Minimum slew rate for the proportional octane rating 
decrease.

      When the adaptive octane memory type is set to "Table Based", the rate 
      should be at least 0.31%/sec. 
      OCT_slew_dec_cur When conditions are validated for octane rating decrease, 
      the octane value will slew at this rate continuously while valid 
      conditions remain. The slew rate is proportional to the knock retard as it 
      increases from the minimum for an octane rating decrease to the maximum 
      allowed retard. 
      OCT_slew_dec_Kd Minimum slew rate for octane rating decrease based on the 
      maximum increase in knock retard during the octane rating decrease window.

      When the adaptive octane memory type is set to "Table Based", the rate 
      should be at least 0.31%/sec. 
      OCT_slew_dec_Kd_max Maximum slew rate for octane rating decrease based on 
      the maximum increase in knock retard during the octane rating decrease 
      window.

      When the adaptive octane memory type is set to "Table Based", the rate 
      should be at least 0.31%/sec. 
      OCT_slew_dec_max Maximum slew rate for the proportional octane rating 
      decrease.

      When the adaptive octane memory type is set to "Table Based", the rate 
      should be at least 0.31%/sec. 
      OCT_slew_inc After key-on, when conditions are validated for octane rating 
      increase, the octane value will slew at this rate continuously while valid 
      conditions remain. When the "Adaptive octane memory type" is set to 'Table 
      Based', the rate should be at least 0.31%/sec. 
      OCT_slew_inc_cur When conditions are validated for octane rating increase, 
      the octane value will slew at this rate continuously while valid 
      conditions remain. This value changes from the key-on increasing octane 
      slew rate to the steady-state increasing octane slew rate after the knock 
      retard reaches the maximum value for an octane rating increase. 
      OCT_slew_inc_mode Indicates the increasing slew rate used by adaptive 
      octane. 
      OCT_slew_inc_ss Increasing octane slew rate to use after the knock retard 
      reaches the maximum value for an octane rating increase. This steady-state 
      rate will be used until the next key-on reset. 
      OCT_ss_tau This is the time-constant of a low-pass filter applied to the 
      MAP and RPM to generate a 'steady-state' MAP and RPM estimate. These 
      'steady-state' values are compared to the instantaneous values to 
      determine if the engine is within a steady-state window for octane 
      adaptive estimation validation. 
      OCT_tbl_store_EE If the Key-on octane rating reset mode is 'Use last 
      value', this switch determines whether the adaptive octane table is 
      retained in battery supported memory or permanent memory.

      In battery supported memory, the adaptive octane table will be cleared if 
      the battery power is removed from the ECM.

      In permanent memory, a key-on reset sequence must be performed to clear 
      the table. 
      OCT_update_tmr This timer begins incrementing when the engine is in a 
      steadystate MAP and RPM region. When it limits at the adaptive validation 
      wait time, octane learning begins. This timer holds at this limit while 
      steadystate conditions hold. 
      OCT_update_wait The engine must be in a steady-state MAP and RPM region 
      for this amount of time before octane adaptation will start.

      OilPgd_chan OilP gauge driver output channel 
      OilPgd_ctl_type This switch controls the gauge driver output type 
      configured in hardware on the ECM. 'Duty-cycle PWM' mode indicates that a 
      simple low-side switch is the output, and 'Resistance Simulation' 
      indicates that the output is configured for this special type of control. 
      OilPgd_DC This is the PWM dutycyle either used directly in PWM dutycycle 
      mode, or the internal PWM dutycycle used to simulate resistance in 
      resistance simulation mode. 
      OilPgd_Id This is the commanded current through the gauge driver circuit. 
      OilPgd_pctref OilP gauge reference percent of scale 
      OilPgd_per Value is only applicable for output channels 'Aux PWM1' through 
      'Aux PWM4'. 'Aux PWM5' has a hardcoded period of 0.5 ms. 
      OilPgd_Ra This is the current actual resistance being generated by the 
      gauge driver circuit as measured by the internal voltage and current 
      feedback systems. 
      OilPgd_Rd This is the current target resistance for the gauge driver 
      circuit. It may include multihelm compensation relative to the tablelookup 
      value. 
      OilPgd_Rdtbl This is the target resistance extracted from the calibration 
      table. 
      OilPgd_Rpu This is the current estimate of the pullup resistance inside 
      the OilP gauge. This value may change with gauge position and/or 
      excitation voltage. 
      OilPgd_Rpu_def This is the default (initial) estimate of the gauge 
      driver's estimate of the pullup resistance inside the gauge itself. This 
      value does not have be accurate - it only affects the initial gauge 
      movement after key-on. 
      OilPgd_Rpu_tau This time-constant determines the effective closed-loop 
      resistance control update rate for the 'Resistance Simulation' mode of 
      operation. It does not apply otherwise. It should generally be set to 
      approximately 100ms, but may be increase or decreased to achieve the 
      desired gauge response time and stability. 
      OilPgd_Vexc_ratio This is the internal resistor divider ratio of the gauge 
      with respect to the supply voltage and ground. If no divider ratio is 
      present internal to the gauge, set this value to 1.0. 
      OilPgd_Vexc_reg This is the voltage regulator level for the internal gauge 
      excitation voltage. If no regulation exists, just set this value above 
      normal operating voltage (such as 36 volts). 
      OilPgd_V_FB This is the current measured voltage at the gauge driver input 
      pin on the ECM connector. It is used in the computation of the simulated 
      sender resistance.

      OILP_gauge_DHena Use this switch to allow the simulated sender driver to 
      drive two (dual-helm) gauges in parallel. Dual-helm mode may either be 
      permanently enabled or it can be indicated using a hardware input channel. 
      A grounded input on any of the pulled-up input selectable choices 
      indicates dual-helm mode. 
      OILP_gauge_DHstat dual-helm oil pressure gauge driver mode indicator 
      OILP_gauge_dz This value defines a +/- cubic deadzone for multi-engine 
      gauge synchronization. Differences between the average of all multi-engine 
      gauges are reduced by a cubic factor relative to this deadzone, but 
      differences >= this deadzone are displayed at exactly the original value. 
      OILP_gauge_sync This switch will synchronize multiple oil pressure gauges 
      on a multi-engine configuration within a cubic deadband as defined below.

      OILP_stat_ena Enables the monitoring of the oil pressure (OILP_press) to 
      record the min pressure and the engine hour meter of the last pressure <= 
      the trigger pressure. 
      OILP_stat_low_rpm Engine speed must be >= this value to allow updates to 
      the oil pressure low hour meter and oil pressure min. 

      This value may be set to 0 to disable this requirement. 
      OILP_stat_lo_HM The hour meter at which the oil pressure met or dropped 
      below the OILP_stat_lo_trig value. 
      OILP_stat_lo_trig If the oil pressure drops to or is less than this 
      trigger limit the oil pressure hour meter will be updated. The oil 
      pressure hour meter update may only trigger once per engine cycle. 
      OILP_stat_lo_wait Specifies the time to wait after engine start before 
      allowing updates to the oil pressure low hour meter and oil pressure min.

      OilQ_active Oil quality monitoring active switch 
      OilQ_alertreps When an oil quality auto-learn sequence is complete, the 
      audible alert (as defined on the 'Diagnostics' page) will perform the 
      'Audible Alert for Non-Audible Warning' alert sequence. The alert sequence 
      is composed of the initial pulse defined on the 'Diagnostics' page and 
      this number of repeated on/off pulses. 
      OilQ_chan Select the appropriate oil quality sensor input channel. Note 
      that all inputs are assumed to be configured as pull-downs. Also note that 
      the diagnostic fault voltage limits on the 'Diagnostics' page do not apply 
      when the input is being used as an oil quality sensor input, since the 
      limits are learned during normal/valid operation. 
      OilQ_ena If 'Enabled' is selected, an oil quality sensor is assumed to be 
      present and oil quality monitoring begins immediately. If 'Auto-sense' is 
      selected, a valid voltage (between the high/low limits defined below) must 
      be received for the 'Oil quality input validation' time before oil quality 
      monitoring will begin. Once an oil quality sensor has been auto-detected, 
      oil quality sensing will remain active unless it is manually 
      disabled/reset by a user. 
      OilQ_rpm_lmt Oil quality detection will be disabled when the engine speed 
      exceeds this limit. 
      OilQ_state Oil quality status 
      OilQ_trimchan If a trim sensor is present, oil quality monitoring can be

      validate the sensor open and sensor closed readings in the nominal voltage 
      learn sequence. 
      OilQ_tvalid Time required to validate a sensor present when the input 
      configuration is set to 'Auto-sense'. This value is also used to validate

      ovlp_Aeff This is the average effective area of the cam overlap over the 
      cam overlap CAD of rotation. It includes any discharge coefficient (Cd). 
      Typically, this value can be computed using the following formula if the 
      intake/exhaust valve lift values are known: 

      Aavg = (Ain*Aexh)/(Ain+Aexh)*(1+Asmall/Alarge*.6), where 

      Ain = intake valve area, 
      Aexh = exhaust valve area, 
      Asmall = min(Ain, Aexh), 
      Alarge = max(Ain, Aexh) 

      Then, the effective area = 

      Cd * integral(Aavg dCAD) / delta-CAD 

      This value is used to compute a VE altitude correction term for high 
      overlap engines. Set this value to zero to disable this feature.

      induction calculation per cylinder relative to the standard or reference 
      value when the engine was calibrated.

      message parking brake switch status (PGN 65465). If "Parking brake 
      position input" is set to an Aux DIG input, then parameter is updated 
      accordingly. However, if "Parking brake position input" is set to an 
      analog input such as 'Aux PU1', then parameter is not applicable. See 
      park_brake_rawfilt for analog voltage feedback.

      Phi_FSO_cs_state Cold start operation state. Possible indications:
      - "Disabled": cold start emissions mode is disabled in the calibration
      - "Wait for start": engine is stopped, or has been running for less than 3 
      seconds
      - "Inactive": after engine start, ECT was above the threshold for cold 
      start operation
      - "Active": after engine start, ECT was below the threshold for cold start 
      operation
      - "Timed out": the engine was running longer than the maximum calibrated 
      time for cold start operation
      - "Complete": CBT exceeded the maximum temperature in the "Post-FSO Phi 
      Catalyst Enrichment" table, and post-FSO enrichment is operating normally 
      Phi_FSO_max_ms See the 'FSO phi catalyst enrichment' comment for details 
      on this parameter. 
      Phi_FSO_offset If non-zero and an active post-cat EGO sensor is available, 
      the phi command will be modified upon exiting fuel shutoff for more rapid 
      catalyst lightoff. The enrichment will end when any of the following are 
      true:
      - "FSO phi catalyst max engagement" time is exceeded.
      - A post-cat sensor lean-to-rich switch is achieved: the post-cat 
      voltage(s) must be greater than "FSO phi catalyst post-EGO switch" AND the 
      last FSO duration must have been longer than "FSO phi catalyst post-EGO 
      switch FSO duration" seconds.
      - For a single-bank application, the relative oxygen level is below the 
      desired relative oxygen level plus the approach delta, "FSO phi catalyst 
      ROL approach delta". 
      Phi_FSO_pst_mode Selects the post-FSO catalyst enrichment mode. The 
      following behaviors are enabled when set to "Enhanced" or "Enhanced + 
CBT":
      - Enables fast closed-loop acquire mode during post-FSO enrichment
      - Uses estimated ROL after one transport delay in conditions determining 
      when to exit post-FSO enrichment
      - Enables use of an optional, alternate TWC diagnostic pre-cat phi target 
      after ROL drops below the post-FSO enrichment threshold and before 
      post-cat phi reaches the diagnostic completion threshold.

      "Enhanced + CBT" mode behaves the same as "Enhanced" mode with the 
      addition to allow the FSO enrichment to be disabled/enabled by the CBT 
      model during a cold start. This also allows use of a multi-point table of 
      FSO enrichment values based on CBT. This will only be active if Cold Start 
      Mode is active. 
      Phi_FSO_pst_ROLapdlt ROL approach delta for exiting post-FSO catalyst 
      enrichment.

      Phi_FSO_pst_sw See the 'FSO phi catalyst enrichment' comment for details 
      on this parameter. 
      Phi_FSO_pst_sw_len The minimum fuel shutoff duration required to allow 
      post-cat voltage to terminate catalyst enrichment after a fuel shutoff 
      event. Set to 0 seconds to disable requirement. See "FSO phi catalyst 
      enrichment" for more details.

      Phi_post_cs_CBT This is the CBT threshold which the CBT model must surpass 
      during a cold start that will allow the switch back to post-cat control 
      mode. This is only active if cold start mode is active. 
      Phi_post_cs_state Cold start operation state. Possible indications:
      - "Disabled": cold start emissions mode is disabled in the calibration
      - "Wait for start": engine is stopped, or has been running for less than 3 
      seconds
      - "Inactive": after engine start, ECT was above the threshold for cold 
      start operation
      - "Active": after engine start, ECT was below the threshold for cold start 
      operation
      - "Timed out": the engine was running longer than the maximum calibrated 
      time for cold start operation
      - "Complete": CBT exceeded the "Cold start continuous phi CBT threshold", 
      and post-cat control will no longer be disabled by cold start operation

      postcat_phi_retard The number of crank angle degrees the spark timing is 
      retarded for low-pressure EGR systems when the post-catalyst phi is below 
      the "Post-cat phi spark retard engage" threshold and EGR is flowing. 
      postphi_ret_CAD Specifies the amount of spark retard to apply when 
      low-pressure EGR is flowing and the post-catalyst phi is below the 
      "Post-cat phi spark retard engage" threshold.

      EGR flow rates of 30% or higher will modify spark timing using this full 
      value. Below 30%, the spark retard value will linearly decrease with the 
      EGR flow rate.

      Enter a positive value for this parameter to indicate the number of crank 
      angle degrees to retard the spark. A value of 0 disables this feature. 
      postphi_ret_diseng When post-catalyst phi based spark retard is active for 
      an engine equipped with a low-pressure EGR system, the phi must rise above 
      this threshold to discontinue modifying spark when the EGR is flowing. 
      postphi_ret_engage For an engine equipped with a low-pressure EGR system, 
      this parameter specifies the threshold to apply post-catalyst phi spark 
      retard when the EGR is flowing. Spark timing is modified when the 
      post-catalyst phi is below this threshold and will continue until the phi 
      rises above the "Post-cat phi spark retard disengage threshold". 
      postphi_ret_FSO_wt Specifies the number of post-catalyst EGO transport 
      delays that must occur before applying post-cat phi spark retard after 
      fuel shutoff exits and the subsequent phi catalyst enrichment ends. 
      power_mode Current power status 
      PPEG_BP_ECT_ena Pressure Offset Pegging: ECT enabling (BP). Certain 
      sensors will exhibit a temperature-dependent drift. Use this to disable 
      sampling during cold operation. 
      PPEG_BP_EEstore Pressure Offset Pegging: Behavior at power-on (BP). At 
      power-on, the previous offset can be restored from EEPROM or the offset 
      can be zeroed. If restored from EEPROM is selected, the pressure offset 
      filter will be initialized with the previous value (allowing for long-term 
      low-pass behavior of the offset pressure). 
      PPEG_BP_enable Pressure Offset Pegging: Enable switch and reference 
      pressure selection (BP). 
      PPEG_BP_fault BP pegging offset out-of-range diagnostic: BP offset sample 
      (absolute value) threshold 
      PPEG_BP_keyon_wt Pressure Offset Pegging: Key-on wait (BP). This value 
      should be set to allow enough time for voltages to stabilize at key-on. 
      PPEG_BP_keyX_wt Pressure Offset Pegging: Key-off clear wait (BP). If 
      non-zero, during the key-off clear period, pressure offset pegging will be 
      allowed. If non-zero and the start inhibit period is set to 0 and either 
      the max port flow or engine speed are set to 0, then the key-off clear 
      period will be the only period where sampling can occur. 
      PPEG_BP_mdot_max Pressure Offset Pegging: Max total port flow (BP). If the 
      maximum mass flow and/or the maximum engine speed are set to 0, pressure 
      offset pegging will only occur during the sampling period following 
      key-on. Otherwise, start may be inhibited during the sampling period (if 
      start inhibit period is non-zero) but pressure offset pegging will 
      continue after the sampling period whenever the engine speed and port mass 
      flow rates are below the specified limits. 
      PPEG_BP_Nmax Pressure Offset Pegging: Max engine speed (BP). If the 
      maximum mass flow and/or the maximum engine speed are set to 0, pressure 
      offset pegging will only occur during the sampling period following 
      key-on. Otherwise, start may be inhibited during the sampling period (if 
      start inhibit period is non-zero) but pressure offset pegging will 
      continue after the sampling period whenever the engine speed and port mass 
      flow rates are below the specified limits. 
      PPEG_BP_offset Pressure Offset Pegging: psi offset to be applied to BP, 
      from pressure pegging at start/low-flow 
      PPEG_BP_ofst_max Pressure Offset Pegging: Max allowed offset (BP). The 
      pressure offset will be limited to +/- this value. 
      PPEG_BP_Pref_max Pressure Offset Pegging: Maximum reference pressure (BP). 
      If the reference pressure is above this limit, pressure offset pegging 
      will be temporarily disabled. Pegging will resume after the reference 
      pressure is between the min/max limits and the invalid condition wait 
      period has elapsed. 
      PPEG_BP_Pref_min Pressure Offset Pegging: Minimum reference pressure (BP). 
      If the reference pressure is below this limit, pressure offset pegging 
      will be temporarily disabled. Pegging will resume after the reference 
      pressure is between the min/max limits and the invalid condition wait 
      period has elapsed. 
      PPEG_BP_start_wt Pressure Offset Pegging: Start inhibit period (BP). If 
      this value is non-zero, starting will be inhibited to allow for a 
      pre-start pressure offset pegging. If this value is 0, starting will not 
      be inhibited and the RPM/mass flow limits below must be used to make sure 
      the conditions are reasonable for a valid pressure comparison. 
      PPEG_BP_state Pressure Offset Pegging state (BP) 
      PPEG_BP_tau Pressure Offset Pegging: Offset low-pass time constant (BP). 
      Low pass filter time constant used to filter the reference - actual 
      pressure reading. 
      PPEG_BP_valid_wt Pressure Offset Pegging: Invalid conditions wait (BP). If 
      the flow rate, engine speed, or reference pressure readings are outside 
      the specified limits, this value determines the delay before offset 
      pegging once the limits are satisfied. The valid period should generally 
      be longer than the key-on wait period. 
      PPEG_CVP1_ECT_ena Certain sensors will exhibit a temperature-dependent 
      drift. Use this to disable sampling during cold operation for the CVP1 
      sensor. 
      PPEG_CVP1_EEstore At power-on, the previous offset for the CVP1 sensor can 
      be restored from EEPROM or the offset can be zeroed. If restored from 
      EEPROM is selected, the pressure offset filter will be initialized with 
      the previous value (allowing for long-term low-pass behavior of the offset 
      pressure). 
      PPEG_CVP1_enable Enables pressure offset pegging for the CVP1 sensor using 
      BP as the reference for an absolute sensor type and 0 psi for a 
      differential sensor type. 
      PPEG_CVP1_fault This CVP1 pegging offset out-of-range diagnostic limit is 
      applied to the instantaneous samples and not the final offset, since the 
      final offset might be limited to a value less than this diagnostic limit. 
      PPEG_CVP1_keyon_wt This value should be set to allow enough time for 
      voltages to stabilize at key-on for the CVP1 sensor. 
      PPEG_CVP1_keyX_wt If non-zero, during the key-off clear period, CVP1 
      pressure offset pegging will be allowed. If non-zero and the start inhibit 
      period is set to 0 and either the max port flow or engine speed are set to 
      0, then the key-off clear period will be the only period where sampling 
      can occur. 
      PPEG_CVP1_mdot_max If the maximum mass flow and/or the maximum engine 
      speed are set to 0, CVP1 pressure offset pegging will only occur during 
      the sampling period following key-on. Otherwise, start may be inhibited 
      during the sampling period (if start inhibit period is non-zero) but 
      pressure offset pegging will continue after the sampling period whenever 
      the engine speed and port mass flow rates are below the specified limits. 
      PPEG_CVP1_Nmax If the maximum mass flow and/or the maximum engine speed 
      are set to 0, CVP1 pressure offset pegging will only occur during the 
      sampling period following key-on. Otherwise, start may be inhibited during 
      the sampling period (if start inhibit period is non-zero) but pressure 
      offset pegging will continue after the sampling period whenever the engine 
      speed and port mass flow rates are below the specified limits. 
      PPEG_CVP1_offset This parameter stores the current CVP1 pressure offset 
      value. 
      PPEG_CVP1_ofst_max The CVP1 pressure offset will be limited to +/- this 
      value. 
      PPEG_CVP1_Pref_max If the reference pressure is above this limit, CVP1 
      pressure offset pegging will be temporarily disabled. Pegging will resume 
      after the reference pressure is between the min/max limits and the invalid 
      condition wait period has elapsed. 
      PPEG_CVP1_Pref_min If the reference pressure is below this limit, CVP1 
      pressure offset pegging will be temporarily disabled. Pegging will resume 
      after the reference pressure is between the min/max limits and the invalid 
      condition wait period has elapsed. 
      PPEG_CVP1_start_wt If this value is non-zero, starting will be inhibited 
      to allow for a pre-start CVP1 pressure offset pegging. If this value is 0, 
      starting will not be inhibited and the RPM/mass flow limits below must be 
      used to make sure the conditions are reasonable for a valid pressure 
      comparison. 
      PPEG_CVP1_state This parameter stores the current CVP1 pressure offset 
      state. 
      PPEG_CVP1_tau Low pass filter time constant used to filter the reference - 
      actual pressure reading for the CVP1 sensor. 
      PPEG_CVP1_valid_wt If the flow rate, engine speed, or reference pressure 
      readings are outside the specified limits, this value determines the delay 
      before CVP1 offset pegging once the limits are satisfied. The valid period 
      should generally be longer than the key-on wait period. 
      PPEG_CVP2_ECT_ena Certain sensors will exhibit a temperature-dependent 
      drift. Use this to disable sampling during cold operation for the CVP2 
      sensor. 
      PPEG_CVP2_EEstore At power-on, the previous offset for the CVP2 sensor can 
      be restored from EEPROM or the offset can be zeroed. If restored from 
      EEPROM is selected, the pressure offset filter will be initialized with 
      the previous value (allowing for long-term low-pass behavior of the offset 
      pressure). 
      PPEG_CVP2_enable Enables pressure offset pegging for the CVP2 sensor using 
      BP as the reference for an absolute sensor type and 0 psi for a 
      differential sensor type. 
      PPEG_CVP2_fault This CVP2 pegging offset out-of-range diagnostic limit is 
      applied to the instantaneous samples and not the final offset, since the 
      final offset might be limited to a value less than this diagnostic limit. 
      PPEG_CVP2_keyon_wt This value should be set to allow enough time for 
      voltages to stabilize at key-on for the CVP2 sensor. 
      PPEG_CVP2_keyX_wt If non-zero, during the key-off clear period, CVP2 
      pressure offset pegging will be allowed. If non-zero and the start inhibit 
      period is set to 0 and either the max port flow or engine speed are set to 
      0, then the key-off clear period will be the only period where sampling 
      can occur. 
      PPEG_CVP2_mdot_max If the maximum mass flow and/or the maximum engine 
      speed are set to 0, CVP2 pressure offset pegging will only occur during 
      the sampling period following key-on. Otherwise, start may be inhibited 
      during the sampling period (if start inhibit period is non-zero) but 
      pressure offset pegging will continue after the sampling period whenever 
      the engine speed and port mass flow rates are below the specified limits. 
      PPEG_CVP2_Nmax If the maximum mass flow and/or the maximum engine speed 
      are set to 0, CVP2 pressure offset pegging will only occur during the 
      sampling period following key-on. Otherwise, start may be inhibited during 
      the sampling period (if start inhibit period is non-zero) but pressure 
      offset pegging will continue after the sampling period whenever the engine 
      speed and port mass flow rates are below the specified limits. 
      PPEG_CVP2_offset This parameter stores the current CVP2 pressure offset 
      value. 
      PPEG_CVP2_ofst_max The CVP1 pressure offset will be limited to +/- this 
      value. 
      PPEG_CVP2_Pref_max If the reference pressure is above this limit, CVP2

      PPEG_CVP2_Pref_min If the reference pressure is below this limit, CVP2 
      pressure offset pegging will be temporarily disabled. Pegging will resume 
      after the reference pressure is between the min/max limits and the invalid

      PTOd_ena Logical: PTO Discrete Controller enabled 
      PTOd_enable_mode If set to "Enable input" (the default):
      - The PTO is initially disabled.
      - Pressing the enable button will enable the PTO. The pending engine speed 
      is set to the last speed target stored to non-volatile memory, the "PTO 
      discrete initial engine speed", or the "PTO slow/min engine speed". 
      Pressing the enable button has no immediate effect on the engine speed.
      - Pressing the disable button will disable the PTO.
      - The first tap of the "set/inc" button after enabled sets the engine 
      speed to the last speed target stored to non-volatile memory or the "PTO 
      set/inc engine speed", and engages the PTO.
      - The first tap of the "resume/dec" button after enabled sets the engine 
      speed to the "PTO resume/dec engine speed", and engages the PTO.
      - The PTO will disengage when the multi-function input control function 
      changes.

      If set to "Always enabled":
      - The PTO is always enabled.
      - Pressing the enable button will engage the PTO. When the vehicle is 
      stopped (less than 0.5 kph) and the foot pedal position is at idle, then 
      the PTO is engaged and the engine speed is set to the last speed target 
      stored to non-volatile memory, the "PTO discrete initial engine speed", or 
      the "PTO slow/min engine speed". Otherwise, if the current engine speed is 
      between the "PTO slow/min engine speed" and the "PTO fast/max engine 
      speed", then the PTO is engaged and the current engine speed will be 
      maintained.
      - Pressing the disable button will disengage the PTO.
      - The first tap of the "set/inc" or "resume/dec" button after enabled has 
      no special behavior.
      - The PTO will be disabled when the multi-function input control function 
      changes.

      If set to "J1939 PTO":
      - The PTO is initially disabled.
      - When disabled, pressing the Accelerate, Decelerate, or Resume button 
      will enable and engage the PTO. When the vehicle is stopped (less than 0.5 
      kph) and the foot pedal position is at idle, then the PTO is engaged and 
      the engine speed is set to the last speed target stored to non-volatile 
      memory, the "PTO discrete initial engine speed", or the "PTO slow/min 
      engine speed". Otherwise, if the current engine speed is between the "PTO 
      slow/min engine speed" and the "PTO fast/max engine speed", then the PTO 
      is engaged and the current engine speed will be maintained.
      - Pressing the Set button will disengage the PTO, but will not reset the 
      PTO set point speed.
      - The first tap of the "set/inc" or "resume/dec" button after enabled has 
      no special behavior.
      - The PTO will be disabled when the multi-function input control function 
      changes.

      Additional behaviors when set to "Always enabled":
      - The PTO will disengage when the actual engine speed is outside of the 
      PTO operating range.
      - A disable input must be configured.
      - The PTO will be disabled if the disable input is faulty.

      Additional behaviors when set to "J1939 PTO":
      - When disengaged, pressing the Resume button will re-engage the PTO. When 
      the vehicle is stopped (less than 0.5 kph) and the foot pedal position is 
      at idle, then the PTO is engaged and the engine speed is set to the PTO 
      speed target at the time the PTO was disengaged. Otherwise, if the current 
      engine speed is between the "PTO slow/min engine speed" and the "PTO 
      fast/max engine speed", then the PTO is engaged and the current engine 
      speed will be maintained. The Resume button has no function while engaged.
      - The PTO will disengage in similar conditions as roadspeed cruise 
      control, such as clutch depressed, foot brake depressed, invalid 
      transmission status, etc. In other configurations, these conditions 
      disable the PTO.

      PTOd_resdec_chan Configures the discrete PTO resume/decrement input. When 
      configured as one of the J1939 CCVS1 SPNs, the input is received from 
      either ECI PGN 65465 or 65467. 
      PTOd_resdec_ramp Discrete PTO RESUME/DECC ramp down rate (PTO + ramp rate 
      to use after the initial wait time)

      PTOd_resdec_sw_stat Discrete PTO resume/decrement switch input status 
      (0=Inactive, 1=Active, 2=Error/Fault, 3=Not Configured). 
      PTOd_resdec_tap PTO rpm decrease for each momentary button press shorter 
      than the ramp up wait time. 
      PTOd_resdec_wait The initial res/- button press will change the PTO target 
      to the engine speed above. After waiting this amount of time, the engine 
      speed will ramp down at the ramp rate specified below. 
      PTOd_res_sw Power take-off (PTO) resume 
      PTOd_rpm_accum Discrete PTO governor target speed (working variable) 
      PTOd_rpm_init Initial PTO engine speed to use when the PTO is engaged in 
      the "Always enabled" or "J1939 PTO" configurations, or when engaged by 
      holding set/+ or res/- longer than the ramp wait time. When "PTO discrete 
      set/inc engine speed retention" is set to "Permanently retained", this 
      value is only used when a previous PTO discrete engine speed has not been 
      stored to non-volatile memory. If set to zero, the "PTO slow/min engine 
      speed" is used instead. 
      PTOd_setinc_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd

      PTOd_setinc_chan Configures the discrete PTO set/increment input. When 
      configured as one of the J1939 CCVS1 SPNs, the input is received from 
      either ECI PGN 65465 or 65467. 
      PTOd_setinc_ramp PTO + ramp rate to use after the initial wait time above. 

      PTOd_setinc_rpm Engine speed target for the initial set/+ button press. 
      See 'PTO discrete set/inc engine speed retention' above. 
      PTOd_setinc_store_EE Selects how the engine speed target is determined for 
      initial PTO engagement. The default initial PTO speed is calculated as 
      follows:
      - If this parameter is set to "Permanently retained", and non-volatile 
      memory contains a set point, then uses the value retained in non-volatile 
      memory;
      - otherwise, uses "PTO discrete initial engine speed" if non-zero, which 
      will be clamped between "PTO slow/min engine speed" and "PTO fast/max 
      engine speed";
      - otherwise, uses "PTO slow/min engine speed".

      For the "J1939 PTO" configuration:
      - The initial engagement speed target is always the default initial PTO 
      speed.

      For other configurations:
      - If this parameter is set to "Reset when disengaged", a set/+ button 
      press sets the speed target to the value specified in the 'PTO discrete 
      set/inc engine speed' calibration variable.
      - If this parameter is set to "Permanently retained":
      * The very first set/+ button press sets the speed target to the value 
      specified in the 'PTO discrete set/inc engine speed' calibration variable.
      * Any subsequent set/+ button press sets the speed target to the value 
      retained in non-volatile memory.

      For all configurations:
      - Holding set/+ or res/- to engage the PTO will start the speed target 
      ramp from the default initial PTO speed.
      - If this parameter is set to "Permanently retained", the latest speed 
      target is retained in non-volatile memory. 
      PTOd_setinc_sw_stat Discrete PTO set/increment switch input status 
      (0=Inactive, 1=Active, 2=Error/Fault, 3=Not Configured). 
      PTOd_setinc_tap PTO rpm increase for each momentary button press shorter 
      than the ramp up wait time. 
      PTOd_setinc_wait The initial set/+ button press will change the PTO target 
      to the engine speed above. After waiting this amount of time, the engine 
      speed will ramp up at the ramp rate specified below. 
      PTOd_setres_rpm Enter the engine speed to use as the PTO target if the 
      set/+ and resume/- buttons are simultaneously pressed. The PTO system will 
      interlock a simultaneous button state and require both buttons return to 
      the off state before taking further action. This setting is not used if 
      set to zero or if "PTO discrete control disabled by simultaneous inputs" 
      is enabled. 
      PTOd_setres_wait Enter an additional debounce time for the set/+ and 
      resume/- inputs. A nonzero time here allows the system time to validate a 
      simultaneous set/+ and resume/- button press without regard to which 
      button is pressed first. However, if nonzero, the PTO system will wait the 
      specified time before accepting either input as ON. 
      PTOd_set_sw Power take-off (PTO) set 
      PTOd_sw Configures the discrete PTO controller enable switch input.

      When configured as one of the J1939 CCVS1 SPNs, the input is received from 
      either ECI PGN 65465 or 65467.

      When configured as J1939 PTO SPN 980, the input is received from ECI PGN 
      42315. Option 'J1939 PTO - SPN 980=01' will have an active indication when 
      SPN has a value of 1. Option 'J1939 PTO - SPN 980=00' is inverted and will 
      have an active indication when SPN has a value of 0. 
      PTOd_sw_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the control activation, this 
      value determines the active logic state(s). Default values are defined 
      when Aux DIG1 through Aux DIG10 are selected for the control activation.

      PTOp_rpm_inst PTO Proportional Controller rpm target speed 
      PTO_brake_override If enabled, PTO will be disabled if the brake is 
      depressed. 
      PTO_clutch_override If enabled, PTO will be disabled if the clutch is 
      depressed. 
      PTO_ebrake_override If enabled, PTO mode will be temporarily disabled if 
      either of the driveline brakes are engaged. Regardless of this setting, 
      the drive brakes (engine, exhaust, and/or transmission retarder) are 
      prohibited from engaging while PTO is active and the PTO set speed > min 
      governor speed + fuel shutoff idle wait. This option determines the PTO 
      behavior when the PTO set speed is below these limits and the drive brakes 
      activate. 
      PTO_ena Power take-off (PTO) proportional control enabled indication 
      PTO_gov_type The discrete 1/2/3 governor settings prohibit user override.

      PTO_rpm_dz Dead zone for disengaging PTO engine speed control. 
      PTO_spdinput Enables and selects input for Power Take Off proportional 
      control. 
      PTO_sw Configures the proportional PTO controller enable switch input. If 
      the brake, clutch, or drivebrake disengage the PTO, the proportional 
      enable switch must be toggled to allow re-engagement of proportional PTO 
      mode. 
      PTO_sw_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the control activation, this 
      value determines the active logic state(s). Default values are defined 
      when Aux DIG1 through Aux DIG10 are selected for the control activation:

      Aux DIG7 = Select
      Aux DIG8 = Select
      Aux DIG9 = Select
      Aux DIG10 = Select 
      PTO_sw_validation If a switch-off validation is required, the PTO switch 
      must transition from off to on following an engine stopped, key-off, 
      cruise-active, roadspeed loss, brake/clutch/drive-brake override, vehicle 
      interlock invalid, or roadspeed too high condition. 
      PTO_vehspd_limit The PTO feature will be disabled if the vehicle speed 
      exceeds this limit. Set this to 0.0 to only allow PTO engagement while the 
      vehicle is stopped. If this value is set to 0.0 and a "Roadspeed loss" 
      fault exists, PTO will be disabled until the roadspeed can be evaluated. 
      PTO_vehspd_min The PTO feature will be disabled if the vehicle speed is 
      below this threshold. Set this to a value greater than 0.5 kph to only 
      allow PTO engagement while the vehicle is moving. 
      PTO_Vfast The upper limit for the PTO engine speed control input.

      condition for all AUX PWM diagnostics. On transitions between duty-cycle 
      fault checking conditions (high-to-low duty cycle or low-to-high 
      duty-cycle transitions), this time must elapse before the PWM fault 
      checking begins. This allows wider limits to be used on the PWM fault 
      checks without artificially latching a fault due to repeated duty-cycle 
      transitions.

      RBC_enabled This input is monitored to determine if 
      transmission/engine/exhaust braking is allowed. 
      RBC_enabled_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the "Retarder braking 
      enabled input", this value determines the active logic state(s). Default 
      values are defined when Aux DIG1 through Aux DIG12 are selected for the 
      control activation:
      Aux DIG1 = Select
      Aux DIG2 = Select
      Aux DIG3 = Select
      Aux DIG4 = Select
      Aux DIG5 = Select
      Aux DIG6 = Select

      RBC_min_ECT_ena Used to disable the Driveline and/or Exhaust brake 
      activation when ECT is less than the corresponding minimum set below. 
      RBC_min_ECT_override Sets the engine run time when the Driveline and 
      Exhaust brake minimum ECT temperature thresholds are no longer required to 
      enable braking. A value of 0 disables the engine run time override, i.e. 
      the minimum ECT is always enforced.
      NOTE: the minimum ECT temperature thresholds and run time override both 
      require 'Retarder disabled by minimum ECT' to be set to YES. 
      RBC_mode_support Retarder torque mode (SPN 900) update method:
      'Brake is engaged (legacy)' - Retarder torque mode is supported when 
      driveline brake is actually engaged.
      'Brake switch is enabled' - Retarder torque mode is supported when 
      driveline brake is enabled.
      This parameter influences the value of SPN 900 in the following ERC1 
      messages:
      0x18F00000 (ECI PGN 61440)
      0x18F0000F (ECI PGN 42489 and 61568) 
      RBC_outofgear Disables brake activation if the driveline is not engaged 
      (e.g. clutch is depressed or transmission is in neutral). Note this only 
      applies to the engine compression and exhaust brake; the transmission 
      retarder is always allowed to engage. 
      RBC_ovrspd_ena If enabled, retarder braking is automatically engaged if an 
      engine overspeed condition is detected in order to reduce engine speed. 
      For the 'Engage at spark rev limit' option, an overspeed condition exists 
      if engine speed exceeds the RPM threshold specified for the "Spark rev 
      limit" diagnostic. An overspeed condition exists for the 'Engage at fixed 
      speed limit' if engine speed exceeds the "Overspeed braking fixed speed 
      limit" parameter value. 

      The type of retarder brake to engage is configured in the "Overspeed 
      braking engagement" parameter. 
      RBC_ovrspd_engage Specifies the type of retarder braking to engage when an 
      engine overspeed condition is detected and "Retarder braking during engine 
      overspeed" is enabled. The selected retarder braking type must be enabled 
      for engagement using the "Driveline brake mode" and/or "Exhaust brake 
      operating mode" parameters. 
      RBC_ovrspd_rpm_lmt Specifies the engine speed threshold to engage retarder 
      braking when an engine overspeed condition is detected. This limit is 
      enforced when "Retarder braking during engine overspeed" is set to 'Engage 
      at fixed speed limit'. 
      RBC_ovrspd_RS_min Specifies the minimum roadspeed required to engage 
      retarder braking when an engine overspeed condition is detected. 
      RBC_TSC1_arb_mode When parameter is set to 'Normal', the TSC1 arbitration 
      process is not modified. This parameter only applies when "J1939 TSC1 
      message prioritization" is set to 'Lowest speed/torque'.

      When set to 'Remove from arbitration', TSC1 requests sent to the retarder 
      are removed from normal TSC1 arbitration. The following ECI PGNs are 
      removed from normal TSC1 arbitration:
      - 0x0C000F03 (ECI PGN 42347)
      - 0x0C000F0B (ECI PGN 42491)
      - 0x0C000F10 (ECI PGN 42352)
      - 0x0C000F21 (ECI PGN 42344)
      - 0x0C000F24 (ECI PGN 42355)
      - 0x0C000F27 (ECI PGN 339)
      - 0x0C000F2A (ECI PGN 42364)
      - 0x0C00290B (ECI PGN 42490)
      - 0x0C002910 (ECI PGN 42326)
      - 0x0C002924 (ECI PGN 42356)
      - 0x0C002927 (ECI PGN 42340 or 42361)

      When set to 'Full authority override', active full authority TSC1 requests 
      will override any active retarder braking TSC1 requests having the same 
      priority (SPN 897).

      A retarder braking TSC1 request is defined as either:
      - A torque control request (SPN 695 set to 2) with a torque value less 
      than 0% (SPN 518).
      - A torque limit request (SPN 695 set to 3) with a torque limit value 
      equal to 0% (SPN 518).

      A full authority TSC1 request is defined as either:
      - A torque control request (SPN 695 set to 2) with a torque value greater 
      than 0% (SPN 518).
      - A speed control request (SPN 695 set to 1) with any speed value (SPN 
      898). 
      RBC_TSC1_disengage Parameter determines how TSC1 retarder braking 
      disengage requests are processed. A retarder braking disengage request is 
      defined as a torque limit request (SPN 695 set to 3) with a torque limit 
      value equal to 0% (SPN 518).

      When set to 'Arbitrate All', then all retarder braking disengage requests 
      are processed by the normal TSC1 arbitration process. Note: retarder 
      braking is not guaranteed to disengage when using this option. For 
      example, when "Retarder braking enabled input" is configured as an Aux DIG 
      input, an active input will override a TSC1 disengage request. This option 
      is not applicable when "Retarder braking TSC1 arbitration mode" is set to 
      'Remove from arbitration'.

      When set to 'Remove 42491 (Legacy)', then all retarder braking disengage 
      requests, except for ECI PGN 42491, are processed by the normal TSC1 
      arbitration process. Note: retarder braking is not guaranteed to disengage 
      when using this option. For example, when "Retarder braking enabled input" 
      is configured as an Aux DIG input, an active input will override a TSC1 
      disengage request. This option is not applicable when "Retarder braking 
      TSC1 arbitration mode" is set to 'Remove from arbitration'.

      When set to 'Disable Retarder Braking', then retarder braking disengage 
      requests are not processed through the normal TSC1 arbitration process. 
      The requests will disable retarder braking and override all other inputs. 
      Overridden inputs include: Aux DIG inputs, SPN 973 in EBC1, and TSC1 
      messages requesting retarder engagement). The only exception is when 
      engine overspeed is detected. This option only supports the following ECI 
      PGNs:
      - 0x0C000F03 (ECI PGN 42347)
      - 0x0C000F0B (ECI PGN 42491)
      - 0x0C000F10 (ECI PGN 42352)
      - 0x0C000F21 (ECI PGN 42344)
      - 0x0C000F24 (ECI PGN 42355)
      - 0x0C000F27 (ECI PGN 339)
      - 0x0C000F2A (ECI PGN 42364)
      - 0x0C00290B (ECI PGN 42490)
      - 0x0C002910 (ECI PGN 42326)
      - 0x0C002924 (ECI PGN 42356)

      reset_learn_reprog Enables TPS idle/full, EGR zero, and pressure sensor 
      offset learning after a flash reprogramming event when "Key-off clear with 
      relay on" is enabled. Learning will execute in a key-on, engine-off state 
      based on the calibration for the key-off clear and pressure offset pegging 
      parameters.

      During post-reprogramming learning, each of the following operations will 
      optionally execute if its associated calibration parameter is enabled:

      - Idle and full TPS voltage learning: "Key-off learn TPS idle/full"
      - EGR 0% valve open feedback voltage learning: "Key-off clear EGR and 
zero"
      - Pressure sensor offset pegging: "Pressure offset pegging"

      The "Key-off clear hold" parameter must be configured with sufficient time 
      to allow all of the enabled learn operations to complete.

      Deposit-clearing TPS and EGR sweep operations are not supported during 
      post-reprogramming learning.

      RMT_ff_torq_mode This software switch controls whether or not any network 
      feedforward torque requests will be supported using PGN 65351/SPN 65144.

      By setting this switch to other than 'Disabled', the value in SPN 65144 
      will be interpreted as a feedforward term in the Gov3 commanded load % 
      computation.

      If this switch is set to 'Enabled - Gov Load %', the value transmitted is 
      interpreted in units of governor load as defined by the no-load/full-load 
      governor calibration.

      If this switch is set to 'Enabled - Ref Torque %', the value transmitted 
      is interpreted as an absolute torque when multiplied by the J1939 Engine 
      Configuration (EC) reference torque. This value is resolved back to 
      governor load % units using the torque estimation calibration.

      RMT_speed_gov_trans Parameter controls Gov3's target speed when 
      transitioning between governors due to a full-authority TSC1 speed request 
      becoming inactive. Full-authority TSC1 speed requests utilize Gov3. When a 
      speed request is no longer active, the active governor will change from 
      Gov3 to the Min or Max governor. However, a governor switch can take up to 
      50ms to complete. In 'Legacy' mode, Gov3 will target Gov3_rpm during the 
      governor transition. In 'Persist Speed Request' mode, Gov3 will target the 
      most recently received RMT_speed value before the request became inactive. 
      The speed request is persisted during the governor switch.

      RMT_torq_lmt Remote torque limit 
      RMT_torq_lmt_SA Remote torque limit source address 
      RMT_torq_SA Remote torque source address 
      RMT_tsc_fpp_ena Enables the operation of both TSC1 Full-Authoritative 
      speed requests and FPP Speed Control for rpm governance.

      In this mode, the foot pedal commands a speed based on position. However, 
      the commanded foot pedal speed value will be overridden by the value 
      received in a TSC1 Full-Authoritative speed request message (refer to TSC1 
      SPNs: 695 and 898).

      When Disabled, TSC1 Full-Authoritative speed requests are ignored, and the 
      FFP Speed Control has full control of the commanded speed value. 
      ROC_attempts_cnt Running-on-cam (ROC) activation attempts counter. 
      ROC_cam_est_rpm_min Parameter is the minimum required camshaft-estimated 
      engine speed when attempting to activate ROC. If camshaft-estimated engine 
      speed (rpm_cam_est) is less than this parameter, then ROC will not be 
      allowed to activate. Parameter can be used to prevent false-positive ROC 
      activations during engine spin-down. Set parameter slightly lower than the 
      cold-ambient cranking speed. To disable parameter, set to 0 rpm. 
      ROC_crank_rpm_min Parameter is the minimum required crankshaft-based 
      engine speed when attempting to activate ROC while cranking the engine. 
      This parameter is only applicable when the crankshaft sensor initially 
      detects teeth, but begins missing teeth while engine is cranking. When run 
      mode is 'Cranking', ROC can only activate if the last known 
      crankshaft-based engine speed is above this parameter. This parameter can 
      be used to prevent false-positive ROC activations after starter disengages 
      and engine is spinning down. Set parameter slightly lower than the 
      cold-ambient cranking speed. To disable parameter, set to 0 rpm. Note: 
      parameter does not prevent ROC activation when no crank teeth are detected 
      while cranking the engine. 
      ROC_ena Parameter enables running-on-cam (ROC) signal if crank signal is 
      lost. Feature only supports the following calibration configuration:
      "Engine type" is set to 'Spark-ignited non-DI'
      "Spark system type" is set to 'Coil Per Cylinder'
      "Fuel type select configuration" is set to 'NG Only' 
      "NG fuel admission device type" is set to 'Continuous Injection'
      "crank-cam module" is set to 'Generic 60-2 crank, 6+1 cam'
      "crank skip teeth" is set to 0
      "crank edge capture" is set to 'Falling Edges'
      "cam1 edge capture" is set to 'Falling Edges'
      "Tachometer output override" is set to 'Disable Override'

      When parameter is set to 'Enabled' and the above calibration criteria are 
      true, the ECM will use the cam signal to run the engine if the crank is 
      considered lost. The crank signal is considered lost if less than half of 
      the expected crank pulses are received between normal cam pulses. The 
      switch to cam can occur during engine cranking or running. After the 
      switch, the engine speed and spark/injection timing will be based on the 
      cam signal.

      Once the switch to the cam signal occurs, the "Crank loss" fault will 
      latch if enabled, knock faults are disabled, and misfire detection is 
      disabled. To switch back to running on the crank signal, the engine must 
      stop and key turned off. 
      ROC_run_rpm_min Parameter is the minimum crankshaft-based engine speed 
      required when attempting to activate ROC after engine has already started. 
      When run mode is 'Running' or 'Underspeed', ROC can only activate if the 
      last known crankshaft-based engine speed is above this parameter. 
      Parameter can be used to prevent false-positive ROC activations during 
      engine spin-down. Set parameter lower than the engine idle speed. To 
      disable parameter, set to 0 rpm. 
      ROC_stat Running-on-cam (ROC) status:
      0 = 'Disabled' - ROC_ena is disabled
      1 = 'Cal Unsupported' - enabled but calibration not supported
      2 = 'Inactive' - enabled but not active
      3 = 'Active' - enabled and active 
      ROC_stop_time_min Parameter is the minimum engine-stopped time before 
      allowing ROC activation while run mode is 'Stopped'. This parameter can 
      indirectly be used to prevent false-positive ROC activations during engine 
      spin-down. At very slow engine speeds, crank teeth may not be detectable 
      while cam teeth are detectable. The run mode will change to 'Stopped' when 
      crank teeth have not been received for 150ms. If a cam tooth is received 
      subsequently, this parameter can be used to prevent ROC from activating. 
      Set parameter to 1-2 seconds. To disable, set parameter to 0 seconds.

      rpm_instant Instantaneous engine speed, valid after crank synchronization. 

      RPM_stat_ena Enables the monitoring of the engine speed (rpm) to record 
      the max speed and the engine hour meter of the last speed >= the trigger 
      speed. 
      RPM_stat_hi_acc Accumulated time while meeting/exceeding the 
      RPM_stats_hi_trig threshold. 
      RPM_stat_hi_HM The hour meter at which the engine speed met or exceeded 
      the RPM_stat_hi_trig value. 
      RPM_stat_hi_trig If the engine speed meets or exceeds this trigger limit 
      the engine speed hour meter will be updated. The engine speed hour meter 
      update may only trigger once per engine cycle. 
      RPM_stat_max The maximum engine speed seens since last reset. 
      RPM_stat_reset_key Specifies the unique key (1-65535) required to clear 
      the engine speed statistics. 
      RPM_stat_reset_usr Engine speed statistics may be reset be setting this 
      variable to the RPM_stat_reset_key value. 
      RS2ovsc_deng This is the delta roadspeed below the target at which the 
      overshoot control will initiate. 
      RS2ovsc_denghyst This is the delta roadspeed below the target and the 
      engage delta at which the overshoot control will be rearmed after being 
      disarmed. 
      RS2ovsc_dIlim This is limit of authority of the integrator ramp rate 
      during roadspeed overshoot control. It is expressed as a positive number 
      even though the actual ramp rate on the integrator will be negative. 
      RS2ovsc_ena This switch enables/disables the roadspeed overshoot control 
      feature. This system introduces a potentially extremely high Kiv gain just 
      as the roadspeed approaches the target, and then removes this gain as soon 
      as the roadspeed derivative becomes <= 0. 
      RS2ovsc_Kiv This is the main gain used by the roadspeed overshoot control 
      system described above. It is only in effect when the system is armed, the 
      roadspeed is >= targetdeltaengage, and roadspeed derivative > 0. 
      RS2ovsc_Kiv_phout This is the time phaseout over which any additional Kiv 
      gain used for overshoot control will be ramped to zero. 
      RS2ovsc_table This switch selects either single-point or table-based 
      overshoot control gains/parameters. The table-based parameters are indexed 
      as a function of desired roadspeed. 
      RS2_dot_dzlim This cubic deadzone limit is applied to the final lowpass 
      acceleration estimation before use in the control loop error terms. 
      RS2_dot_ovsc_tau This is the time constant used to lowpass RS_dot todetect 
      a deceleration transition after overshoot control has approached the 
      target setspeed.

      RS2_dot_window Time value over which to estimate the acceleration 
      RS2_gainset Control parameter set selection - set 2 
      RS2_Kd Road speed limiting PID loop derivative gain. This is the only Kd 
      gain used if the Kd_accel gain is set to < 900.0 (such as 999.0). If, 
      however, Kd_accel is set to a number > 900.0 (such as a normal positive 
      value), then this Kd gain becomes the Kd_decel gain and is only used when 
      the acceleration error is positive (deceleration). 
      RS2_Kd_accel Road speed limiting PID loop acceleration derivative gain. 
      Setting this gain to avalue > 900.0 (such as a normal positive number) 
      causes this gain to be used as the Kd when the acceleration error is 
      negative (acceleration). Setting this value to < 900.0 (such as 999.0) 
      causes this gain to be ignored and the standard Kd / Kd_decel gain is used 
      regardless of the sign of the acceleration error. 
      RS2_Ki Road speed limiting PID loop integrator gain. 
      RS2_Kiv Road speed limiting PID loop integral derivative 
      RS2_Kivapp_add During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be used at its full value (100% 
      Kiv adder). This is the Kiv adder that will be added to the base Kiv value 
      depending on the roadspeed error from the final target. The two values 
      below define how this adder is phased in as the roadspeed error increases 
      away from the setpoint. 
      RS2_Kivapp_RS0 During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be completely eliminated (adder 
      = 0). At roadspeed errors larger than this value, the adder will be 
      linearly increased from zero toward the full adder value at the 'full' 
      approach value. 
      RS2_Kivapp_RS100 During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be used at its full value (100% 
      Kiv adder). At roadspeed errors smaller than this value, the adder will be 
      linearly decreased toward zero as the 'zero' value is approached. 
      RS2_Kp Road speed limiting PID loop proportional gain. 
      RS2_Kp_dz This is the cubic deadzone that will be applied to the 
      proportional (Kp) error term for roadspeed control. 
      RS2_Kp_dz_tout This is a timeout value that will be used each time the 
      roadspeed error term exceeds the proportional (Kp) deadzone value. During 
      the timeout period, the deadzone value will be temporarily set to zero. 
      RS2_source This switch determines the source for the ground speed 
      measurement information. 
      RS2_speed_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the road speed 
      RS2_TPS_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the road speed 
      RS3ovsc_deng This is the delta roadspeed below the target at which the 
      overshoot control will initiate. 
      RS3ovsc_denghyst This is the delta roadspeed below the target and the 
      engage delta at which the overshoot control will be rearmed after being 
      disarmed. 
      RS3ovsc_dIlim This is limit of authority of the integrator ramp rate 
      during roadspeed overshoot control. It is expressed as a positive number 
      even though the actual ramp rate on the integrator will be negative. 
      RS3ovsc_ena This switch enables/disables the roadspeed overshoot control 
      feature. This system introduces a potentially extremely high Kiv gain just 
      as the roadspeed approaches the target, and then removes this gain as soon 
      as the roadspeed derivative becomes <= 0. 
      RS3ovsc_Kiv This is the main gain used by the roadspeed overshoot control 
      system described above. It is only in effect when the system is armed, the 
      roadspeed is >= target deltaengage, and roadspeed derivative > 0. 
      RS3ovsc_Kiv_phout This is the time phaseout over which any additional Kiv 
      gain used for overshoot control will be ramped to zero. 
      RS3ovsc_table This switch selects either singlepoint or tablebased 
      overshoot control gains/parameters. The tablebased parameters are indexed 
      as a function of desired roadspeed. 
      RS3_dot_dzlim This cubic deadzone limit is applied to the final lowpass 
      acceleration estimation before use in the control loop error terms. 
      RS3_dot_ovsc_tau This is the time constant used to lowpass RS_dot to 
      detect a deceleration transition after overshoot control has approached 
      the target setspeed. 
      RS3_dot_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the 
      RS3_dot_window Time value over which to estimate the acceleration 
      RS3_gainset Control parameter set 3 selection 
      RS3_Kd Road speed limiting PID loop derivative gain. This is the only Kd 
      gain used if the Kd_accel gain is set to < 900.0 (such as 999.0). If, 
      however, Kd_accel is set to a number > 900.0 (such as a normal positive 
      value), then this Kd gain becomes the Kd_decel gain and is only used when 
      the acceleration error is positive (deceleration). 
      RS3_Kd_accel Road speed limiting PID loop acceleration derivative gain. 
      Setting this gain to a value > 900.0 (such as a normal positive number) 
      causes this gain to be used as the Kd when the acceleration error is 
      negative (acceleration). Setting this value to < 900.0 (such as 999.0) 
      causes this gain to be ignored and the standard Kd / Kd_decel gain is used 
      regardless of the sign of the acceleration error. 
      RS3_Ki Road speed limiting PID loop integrator gain. 
      RS3_Kiv Road speed limiting PID loop integral derivative 
      RS3_Kivapp_add During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be used at its full value (100% 
      Kiv adder). This is the Kiv adder that will be added to the base Kiv value 
      depending on the roadspeed error from the final target. The two values 
      below define how this adder is phased in as the roadspeed error increases 
      away from the setpoint. 
      RS3_Kivapp_RS0 During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be completely eliminated (adder 
      = 0). At roadspeed errors larger than this value, the adder will be 
      linearly increased from zero toward the full adder value at the 'full' 
      approach value. 
      RS3_Kivapp_RS100 During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be used at its full value (100% 
      Kiv adder). At roadspeed errors smaller than this value, the adder will be 
      linearly decreased toward zero as the 'zero' value is approached. 
      RS3_Kp Road speed limiting PID loop proportional gain. 
      RS3_Kp_dz This is the cubic deadzone that will be applied to the 
      proportional (Kp) error term for roadspeed control. 
      RS3_Kp_dz_tout This is a timeout value that will be used each time the 
      roadspeed error term exceeds theproportional (Kp) deadzone value. During 
      the timeout period, the deadzone value will be temporarily set to zero. 
      RS3_source This switch determines the source for the ground speed 
      measurement information. 
      RS3_speed_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the road speed 
      RS3_TPS_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the road speed 
      RS485_bad_fmt RS-485 Invalid Packet Format diagnostic: number of invalid 
      formats minimum packet threshold 
      RS485_Rx_inact RS-485 Rx inactive diagnostic: "power alive" minimum 
      duration threshold 
      RS485_Rx_noise RS-485 Rx noise diagnostic: minimum number of noisy packets 
      threshold 
      RS485_SD_rq RS-485 shutdown request diagnostic: minimum number of shutdown 
      requests threshold 
      RSC_CAN_set_sw This parameter determines how receipt of the "Cruise 
      Control Set Switch" (SPN 599) in the J1939 Cruise Control/Vehicle Speed 1 
      (CCVS1) PGN is processed. If set to "Engage only", receipt of SPN 599 with 
      a value of 0x01 (Cruise control activator in position "set") will engage 
      cruise control if currently disengaged. Any subsequent active set switch 
      signals are ignored once cruise control is engaged. 

      If this parameter is set to "Engage + disengage", receipt of SPN 599 value 
      0x01 will also engage cruise control if currently disengaged. However, 
      subsequent active set switch signals will disengage cruise control.

      For the "Disengage only" option, receipt of SPN value 0x01 will only 
      disengage cruise control if currently engaged. 

      This parameter only applies when the 'Roadspeed cruise set/inc input' and 
      'Roadspeed cruise set/dec input' parameters are set to "CAN sourced".

      RSC_CCVS_status Roadspeed cruise status:
      • Disabled
      • Holding
      • Accelerating
      • Decelerating
      • Resuming
      • Setting
      • User Override 
      RSC_control_device Parameter selects the device which controls the cruise 
      control engagement/disengagement, roadspeed setpoint, and min FPP cruise 
      control governor. When set to 'ECM', then the engagement and computation 
      of the cruise control governor is internal to the ECM.

      When set to 'External - P2 Torque Control', then an external device 
      computes the cruise control governor and sends a TSC1 torque control 
      request with a P2 control purpose. The "J1939 TSC1 P2 control purpose" 
      calibration parameter must be enabled on the Comms worksheet. See "J1939 
      TSC1 P2 control purpose" for details. When cruise control is enabled 
      (RSC_enabled) and a valid P2 torque control message is received, then 
      cruise control will engage and RMT_P2_load will be stored into the min FPP 
      governor (RS_min_FPP). Cruise control will disengage if RSC_enabled is 
      false or the TSC1 P2 message times out or is no longer requesting torque 
      control. The max roadspeed governor (RS_max_FPP) is still computed and 
      controlled by the ECM while cruise control is engaged.

      Cruise control entry conditions and overrides are the responsibility of 
      the external device which is providing the P2 TSC1 message. The ECM's only 
      entry condition is RSC_enabled which contains the following conditions 
      when external device is controlling cruise:
      - Roadspeed must be greater than "Roadspeed cruise min speed disengage". 
      Set to 0 km/hr to disable criteria.
      - "Roadspeed cruise enable" input is active. Set to 'Always enabled' to 
      always allow cruise control.

      The following ECM calibration parameters will not be applicable when an 
      external device is controlling cruise control: RSC_disable_by_RBC, 
      RSC_disable_2inputs, RSC_min_kph, RSC_max_kph, RSC_disable_rpm, 
      RSC_resume_ramp, RSC_setinc_tap, RSC_setinc_wait, RSC_setinc_ramp, 
      RSC_setdec_tap, RSC_setdec_wait, RSC_setdec_ramp, RSC_ramp_time_max, 
      RSC_error_pct, RSC_error_wait, RSC_CAN_set_sw, and AMT_neut_coast_mode.

      The following ECM measurements will not be available when an external 
      device is controlling cruise control: RS_FPPmin_Iacc, RS_speed_d, 
      RSC_speed_accum, RSC_speed_slew, RSC_CCVS_status, and AMT_RSC_suspend.

      The ECM's cruise control switch inputs for 
      disable/resume/increment/decrement can still be configured and broadcasted 
      to the external device using ECI PGN 42278. 
      RSC_disable_2inputs If enabled, roadspeed cruise is disabled if two or 
      more resume, set, accelerate (set/+) or decelerate (set/-) active input 
      signals are received simultaneously. 
      RSC_disable_by_RBC Disables cruise when retarder braking is allowed by 
      conditions in "Retarder Braking Control", or after receiving a J1939 ERC1 
      message with any of the following conditions:
      - SPN 520, "Actual Retarder - Percent Torque" is negative, or
      - SPN 1715, "Drivers Demand Retarder - Percent Torque" is negative; or
      - SPN 900, "Retarder Torque Mode", is not set to 0, "No request". 
      RSC_disable_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG9 = Gnd
      Aux DIG10 = Gnd
      Aux DIG11 = Gnd
      Aux DIG12 = Gnd
      Aux DIG13 = Gnd
      Aux DIG14 = Gnd
      Aux DIG15 = Gnd
      Aux DIG16 = Gnd
      Aux DIG17 = Gnd
      Aux DIG18 = Gnd
      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      RSC_disable_chan Can optionally be paired with a momentary Cruise Enable 
      switch. If a Cruise Disable switch is configured, the momentary Cruise 
      Enable will no longer toggle between ON and OFF states. The Cruise Enable 
      will only toggle ON. The Cruise Disable is by default a momentary switch. 
      RSC_disable_kph Enter the absolute minimum vehicle speed allowed while 
      cruise is active. If the vehicle speed drops below this limit at any time, 
      cruise will be automatically disengaged. This limit should generally be 
      set considerably below the minimum speed setpoint above. Set this value to 
      0.0 to disable this feature. 
      RSC_disable_rpm If the engine speed fails below this limit, cruise will 
      disengage if active. If not active, the engine speed must reach or exceed 
      this limit before cruise will engage.

      Set this value to 0 to disable this feature. 
      RSC_disable_sw_stat Roadspeed cruise disable switch input status 
      (0=Inactive, 1=Active, 2=Error/Fault, 3=Not Configured). 
      RSC_enabled Latched version of cruise enabled state, used for momentary 
      button presses 
      RSC_enable_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG9 = Gnd
      Aux DIG10 = Gnd
      Aux DIG11 = Gnd
      Aux DIG12 = Gnd
      Aux DIG13 = Gnd
      Aux DIG14 = Gnd
      Aux DIG15 = Gnd
      Aux DIG16 = Gnd
      Aux DIG17 = Gnd
      Aux DIG18 = Gnd
      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      RSC_enable_chan If set to "CAN sourced", receipt of "Cruise Control Enable 
      Switch" (SPN 596) in the J1939 Cruise Control/Vehicle Speed 1 (CCVS1) PGN 
      will enable or disable full-authority roadspeed cruise control.

      Set this value to "Always enabled" to enable roadspeed cruise if no enable 
      switch input is available or desired. Any actual enable switch input is 
      ignored in this mode. Set/inc, set/dec, and resume inputs are still 
      required to engage cruise control. If the disable switch is configured in 
      this mode, cruise will disengage when the switch is ON. 
      RSC_enable_moment Roadspeed cruise enable switch type (toggle or momentary 
      switch) 
      RSC_enable_sw_stat Roadspeed cruise enable switch input status 
      (0=Inactive, 1=Active, 2=Error/Fault, 3=Not Configured). 
      RSC_engaged Logical indicating roadspeed cruise is engaged 
      RSC_engaged_light Determines the output channel for the roadspeed cruise 
      engaged light 
      RSC_error_pct If active cruise control fails to bring the vehicle's 
      roadspeed within this error margin above or below the cruise setpoint 
      within the duration specified in the "Roadspeed cruise persistent error 
      disengage time" parameter, cruise control will be disengaged. This feature 
      is not enforced when accelerator override above the cruise setpoint is 
      applied or the set/+ or set/- buttons are in use.

      Set this value to 0% to disable this feature. 
      RSC_error_wait If active cruise control fails to bring the vehicle's 
      roadspeed within the "Roadspeed cruise persistent error threshold" margin 
      above or below the cruise setpoint within the duration specified by this 
      parameter, cruise control will be disengaged. This feature is not enforced 
      when accelerator override above the cruise setpoint is applied or the 
      set/+ or set/- buttons are in use. 
      RSC_gainset_reengage Parameter provides hysteresis for reengaging 'Cruise 
      Engaged' roadspeed control parameters when cruise control is engaged. When 
      the 'Cruise Engaged' roadspeed control parameters are actively being used, 
      the roadspeed must be below the instantaneous maximum roadspeed limit. If 
      the roadspeed exceeds the maximum roadspeed limit, then the roadspeed 
      control parameters will switch to another set (to 'Default' if no others 
      are enabled). The 'Cruise Engaged' roadspeed control parameters are 
      reengaged after the roadspeed drops below the maximum roadspeed limit 
      minus this parameter's value. Parameter is only applicable when one of the 
      "Control parameter set selection" values is configured as 'Cruise 
      Engaged'. 
      RSC_max_kph Roadspeed cruise max speed setpoint 
      RSC_min_kph Roadspeed cruise min speed setpoint 
      RSC_ramp_time_max While cruise is active, if a set/+ or set/- active input 
      signal is continuously received for this amount of time, cruise will 
      disengage. 

      This function is not available when 'Roadspeed cruise enable' is set to 
      "Always enabled". 
      RSC_resume_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG6 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG7 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG8 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG9 = Gnd
      Aux DIG10 = Gnd
      Aux DIG11 = Gnd
      Aux DIG12 = Gnd

      Aux DIG18 = Gnd
      Aux DIG19 = Gnd
      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      RSC_resume_chan A momentary press of the resume input will install the 
      previous cruise control setpoint if cruise control is enabled. If the 
      set/+ input below is configured for a different input than this switch, 
      this switch serves no other purpose. Otherwise, it is also used as an 
      increment (without functioning as a 'set' input) input.

      If this value is set to 'CAN sourced', then the J1939 Cruise 
      Control/Vehicle Speed 1 (CCVS1) PGN will provide set, resume, increment, 
      and decrement input signals. Any values other than 'CAN sourced' for the 
      "Roadspeed cruise set/inc input" and "Roadspeed cruise set/dec input" 
      parameters are ignored when this value is set to 'CAN sourced'. 
      RSC_resume_ramp When 'resume' is pressed after temporarily exiting cruise 
      control, the speed setpoint is slewed to the previous target speed at this 
      rate. 
      RSC_resume_sw_stat Roadspeed cruise resume switch input status 
      (0=Inactive, 1=Active, 2=Error/Fault, 3=Not Configured). 
      RSC_retard_braking Determines if retarders (transmission, engine 
      compression, exhaust butterfly valve) are allowed to engage while 
      roadspeed cruise control is active. 
      RSC_setdec_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value 
      determines the active logic state(s). The Default values are:
      Aux DIG1 = Gnd
      Aux DIG2 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG3 = Gnd
      Aux DIG4 = +V/Gnd
      Aux DIG5 = +V/Gnd

      Gov1 = Gnd
      Gov2 = Gnd 
      RSC_setdec_chan Configure the vehicle speed set/- input.For 4-switch 
      cruise control setups (on/off, resume, set/+, set/-):
      --------------------------------------
      Select an input different than the resume input above. This input will 
      latch the current vehicle speed when pressed for time < ramp down wait, 
      and will decrease the target speed if pressed longer.

      For 3-switch cruise control setups with shared resume/dec (on/off, 
      resume/-, set/+):
      --------------------------------------------------
      Set the set/- and resume inputs to the same pin. The pin will then 
      function as a resume switch when pressed for time < ramp down wait (i.e. 
      it will not latch the current vehicle speed when pressed momentarily; only 
      the set/+ switch can be used to latch the current vehicle speed). When 
      pressed for time > ramp down wait, this input pin will function as the 
      set/-switch and will decrease the target vehicle speed.

      For "CAN sourced" input: 
      ------------------------------
      If this value is set to "CAN sourced", then the J1939 Cruise 
      Control/Vehicle Speed 1 (CCVS1) PGN will provide set, resume, increment 
      and decrement inputs. Any values other than "CAN sourced" for the 
      'Roadspeed cruise resume input' and 'Roadspeed cruise set/inc input' 
      parameters are ignored when this value is set to "CAN sourced". 
      RSC_setdec_ramp Configures the roadspeed cruise SET/Decrement ramp rate

      RSC_setdec_wait Configures the roadspeed cruise SET/Decrement ramp wait 
      time 
      RSC_setinc_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the input, this value

      RSC_setinc_chan Configure the vehicle speed set/+ input.For 4-switch 
      cruise control setups (on/off, resume, set/+, set/-):
      --------------------------------------
      Select an input different than the resume input above. This input will 
      latch the current vehicle speed when pressed for time < ramp up wait, and 
      will increase the target speed if pressed longer.

      For 3-switch cruise control setups with shared resume/inc (on/off, 
      resume/+, set/-):
      --------------------------------------------------
      Set the set/+ and resume inputs to the same pin. The pin will then 
      function as a resume switch when pressed for time < ramp up wait (i.e. it 
      will not latch the current vehicle speed when pressed momentarily; only 
      the set/- switch can be used to latch the current vehicle speed). When 
      pressed for time > ramp up wait, this input pin will function as the set/+ 
      switch and will increase the target vehicle speed.

      For "CAN sourced" input: 
      ------------------------------
      If this value is set to "CAN sourced", then the J1939 Cruise 
      Control/Vehicle Speed 1 (CCVS1) PGN will provide set, resume, increment 
      and decrement inputs. Any values other than "CAN sourced" for the 
      'Roadspeed cruise resume input' and 'Roadspeed cruise set/dec input' 
      parameters are ignored when this value is set to "CAN sourced". 
      RSC_setinc_ramp Configures the roadspeed cruise SET/Increment ramp rate 
      RSC_setinc_sw_stat Roadspeed cruise set/increment switch input status 
      (0=Inactive, 1=Active, 2=Error/Fault, 3=Not Configured). 
      RSC_setinc_tap Configures the roadspeed cruise SET/Increment tap step 
      RSC_setinc_wait Configures the roadspeed cruise SET/Increment ramp wait 
      time

      RSdrop_kph_arm Instantaneous Dropout Fault condition 
      RSdrop_kph_trig Roadspeed loss diagnostic (alternate instantaneous dropout 
      detection method): subsequent (slower) roadspeed, measured over a 
      calibrated duration 
      RSdrop_rpm_arm Instantaneous Dropout Fault condition 
      RSdrop_status Roadspeed dropout detection

      RSdrop_tout_disarm Instantaneous Dropout Fault condition 
      RSdrop_tout_trig Instantaneous Dropout Fault condition 
      RSovsc_armed This is an indicator which reports the armed/disarmed status 
      of the roadspeed overshoot control system. It is armed whenever roadspeed 
      control is out of authority and the roadspeed droops. It is disarmed once 
      the roadspeed derivative <= 0 and the roadspeed is near the target. 
      RSovsc_deng This is the delta roadspeed below the target at which the 
      overshoot control will initiate. 
      RSovsc_denghyst This is the delta roadspeed below the target and the 
      engage delta at which the overshoot control will be rearmed after being 
      disarmed. 
      RSovsc_dIlim This is limit of authority of the integrator ramp rate during 
      roadspeed overshoot control. It is expressed as a positive number even 
      though the actual ramp rate on the integrator will be negative. 
      RSovsc_dIlim_a Roadspeed overshoot control rate limit 
      RSovsc_ena This switch enables/disables the roadspeed overshoot control 
      feature. This system introduces a potentially extremely high Kiv gain just 
      as the roadspeed approaches the target, and then removes this gain as soon 
      as the roadspeed derivative becomes <= 0. 
      RSovsc_Kiv This is the main gain used by the roadspeed overshoot control 
      system described above. It is only in effect when the system is armed, the 
      roadspeed is >= targetdeltaengage, and roadspeed derivative > 0. 
      RSovsc_Kiv_a Roadspeed overshoot control Kiv 
      RSovsc_Kiv_phout This is the time phaseout over which any additional Kiv 
      gain used for overshoot control will be ramped to zero. 
      RSovsc_table This switch selects either singlepoint or tablebased 
      overshoot control gains/parameters. The tablebased parameters are indexed 
      as a function of desired roadspeed. 
      RSP_selected currently selected roadspeed parameter set (0,1,2 = Set1,2,3) 

      RS_ana_raw roadspeed mag pickup bias voltage feedback 
      RS_CAN_source Specifies which received J1939 PGN is used for ground speed 
      measurement information when the active roadspeed signal source is set to 
      "J1939 Comm". The default option uses the most recent message and ignores 
      previous messages. 

      The "J1939 TCO1" option takes the roadspeed signal from the received 
      "Tachograph Vehicle Speed" (SPN 1624) contained in the Tachograph 1 PGN. 

      The CCVS option sources the roadspeed signal from the received "Wheel 
      Based Vehicle Speed" (SPN 84) in the Cruise-Control / Vehicle Speed PGN. 
      RS_capture roadspeed edge capture 
      rs_digital_config Roadspeed configuration 
      RS_dir Roadspeed direction 
      RS_disc_ana Roadspeed sensor disconnected measured voltage w/ MAG_BIAS 
      RS_disc_calc Roadspeed sensor disconnected calculated offset + MAG_BIAS 
      RS_disc_ena Roadspeed disconnected diags test enable/disable 
      RS_disc_rpm Roadspeed disconnected engine rpm threshold 
      RS_disc_thr Roadspeed sensor disconnected offset 
      RS_disc_tmr The number of seconds between attempts to run the roadspeed 
      sensor disconnected diagnostic test.

      If the key position is ON and the engine is running, this period value 
      will be used. If the key position is ON, but the engine is NOT running, 
      the period value defaults to 1 second.

      NOTE: With key-ON and engine-OFF the test runs at a faster rate because 
      there is no fear of missing legitimate roadspeed pulses.

      This fault only applies to mag pick-up roadspeed sensors. 
      RS_disc_Vbat Roadspeed disconnected diags runs if over this voltage 
      RS_dot Current measured derivative of road speed 
      RS_dot_dz Current measured derivative of road speed with deadzone applied. 

      RS_dot_dzlim This cubic deadzone limit is applied to the final lowpass 
      acceleration estimation before use in the control loop error terms. 
      RS_dot_ovsc_tau This is the time constant used to lowpass RS_dot to detect 
      a deceleration transition after overshoot control has approached the 
      target setspeed. 
      RS_dot_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the 
      RS_dot_window Time value over which to estimate the acceleration 
      RS_dt This is the current instantaneous time between 
      RS_ena Use this switch to enable/disable the roadspeed governing function. 
      If this switch is set to 'Enable - Limit Max + Cruise', all the 'Enable - 
      Limit Max' options still apply. However, the options available in the 
      cruise control section below will simultaneously be used to generate a 
      minimum throttle position. 
      RS_FPPmax_Iacc Current roadspeed control integrator value 
      RS_FPPmin_Iacc Current roadspeed control integrator value 
      RS_freq_raw Unfiltered roadspeed pulse input frequency 
      RS_gainset Control parameter set selection 
      RS_GPS_UA_tout Selects the amount of time the GPS control parameter set 
      remains a valid source during a GPS UNACQUIRED state. 
      RS_hist_avg_t The length of time over which the roadspeed will be sampled 
      from pulse versus time data. This should be >= 20ms and <= 150ms. 
      RS_hist_tout Timeout value during lack of receiving pulses to label as 
      zero speed. This value should be >= 50ms and <= 190ms, and should also be 
      > the speed averaging window time. Typical value is 150ms - no real reason 
      to change. 
      RS_hiV Roadspeed diagnostic internal 05V high voltage 
      RS_HW_cfg Roadspeed input hardware interface configuration. 
      RS_HW_switch This selection determines the hardware input (if any) that is 
      used to enable roadspeed limiting. Set this switch to disabled if using 
      roadspeed cruise control mode. 
      rs_Hz_capture logical YES/NO indicating whether the roadspeed input can be 
      used for PWM input capture 
      RS_Iacc Current roadspeed control integrator value 
      RS_Iacc_init Roadspeed Control Parameters initial Integrator for cases 
      where J1939 sourced RS will never be received 
      RS_input_redirect This switch allows hardware edge events coming into the 
      roadspeed input pin to redirect to other software handling routines (such 
      as Cam1 or Cam2). For example, if a hardware platform does not have a 
      physical (i.e. hardware) Cam2 input channel but does have an available 
      Roadspeed input channel, this switch can be set to Cam2 to make the 
      platform behave as if the Roadspeed input pin is connected to the Cam2 
      input pin. 
      RS_Kd Road speed limiting PID loop derivative gain. This is the only Kd 
      gain used if the Kd_accel gain is set to < 900.0 (such as 999.0). If, 
      however, Kd_accel is set to a number > 900.0 (such as a normal positive 
      value), then this Kd gain becomes the Kd_decel gain and is only used when 
      the acceleration error is positive (deceleration). 
      RS_Kd_accel Road speed limiting PID loop acceleration derivative gain. 
      Setting this gain to avalue > 900.0 (such as a normal positive number) 
      causes this gain to be used as the Kd when the acceleration error is 
      negative (acceleration). Setting this value to < 900.0 (such as 999.0) 
      causes this gain to be ignored and the standard Kd / Kd_decel gain is used 
      regardless of the sign of the acceleration error. 
      RS_Ki Road speed limiting PID loop integrator gain. 
      RS_Kiv Road speed limiting PID loop integral derivative 
      RS_Kivapp_add During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be used at its full value (100% 
      Kiv adder). This is the Kiv adder that will be added to the base Kiv value 
      depending on the roadspeed error from the final target. The two values 
      below define how this adder is phased in as the roadspeed error increases 
      away from the setpoint. 
      RS_Kivapp_RS0 During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be completely eliminated (adder 
      = 0). At roadspeed errors larger than this value, the adder will be 
      linearly increased from zero toward the full adder value at the 'full' 
      approach value. 
      RS_Kivapp_RS100 During conditions in which the roadspeed is not in proper 
      tolerance, an additional Kiv 'adder' can be used to increase the effective 
      Kiv gain to prevent over/under shoot. This value is the +/ deadband from 
      the target roadspeed where the adder will be used at its full value (100% 
      Kiv adder). At roadspeed errors smaller than this value, the adder will be 
      linearly decreased toward zero as the 'zero' value is approached. 
      RS_Kp Road speed limiting PID loop proportional gain. 
      RS_kph_crct_ena If enabled, the actual roadspeed signal is derived by 
      looking up the measured roadspeed signal. This transformation table can be 
      used to correct the measured roadspeed from non-linear roadspeed pulse 
      sensors, such as paddle-wheels. A (0,0) entry is assumed prior to the 
      start of this table for interpolations below the first entry in the table. 
      For interpolations beyond the last entry in the table, a fixed speed 
      offset is assumed. For example, if the last entry is 40kph measured = 
      42kph actual, then 55kph measured will translate to 55+2=57kph actual. 
      RS_Kp_dz This is the cubic deadzone that will be applied to the 
      proportional (Kp) error term for roadspeed control. 
      RS_Kp_dz_tout This is a timeout value that will be used each time the 
      roadspeed error term exceeds the proportional (Kp) deadzone value. During 
      the timeout period, the deadzone value will be temporarily set to zero. 
      RS_loss Roadspeed input loss fault condition 
      RS_loss_MAP Roadspeed input loss fault condition 
      RS_loss_PTO_stat "Roadspeed loss" fault condition - PTO status. When 
      parameter is set to "Inactive", the roadspeed loss diagnostic test will 
      only run when all PTO status are inactive. PTO status include both 
      proportional and discrete control modes. When parameter is set to 
      "Ignored", PTO status are not used as a fault condition.

      Note: this setting does not apply to instantaneous dropout detection, only 
      the engine load portion of the diagnostic test. 
      RS_loss_RPM Roadspeed input loss fault condition 
      RS_loss_slowPWM Roadspeed loss diagnostic: slow PWM input validation 
      requirement 
      RS_loV Roadspeed diagnostic internal 05V low voltage 
      rs_mag_dec_tau roadspeed input mag decreasing tau 
      rs_mag_inc_tau roadspeed input mag increasing tau 
      rs_mag_maxpct Limits the PWM trigger level output to this percentage of 
      the adaptive trigger level measurement. Generally, 80% provides reasonably 
      robust performance. 
      rs_mag_trig_min Amplitude, multiply by 2 for peak-to-peak voltage trigger. 

      RS_max_allspeed_ena When FPP control is configured for all-speed mode and 
      the roadspeed function is configured to limit max throttle the default 
      mode of operation is to limit road speed by adjusting the maximum throttle 
      command. When this setting is enabled roadspeed will be limited by instead 
      adjusting the maximum RPM and allowing the governor to implement the 
      limit. 
      RS_max_allspeed_rpm Roadspeed limited maximum RPM when operating in 
      all-speed mode and limiting max TPS (e.g. when Roadspeed rPM-based 
      all-speed limit function is enabled (RS_max_allspeed_ena)) 
      RS_max_allspeed_use This boolean value indicates when the roadspeed max 
      all-speed rpm is actively limiting RPM. 
      RS_max_FPP Roadspeed max FPP command 
      RS_max_load Currently computed engine load limit due to 
      RS_max_load_inc_slew Maximum increasing slew rate of the road speed load 
      limit when the road speed input is lost and the foot pedal is off-idle. 
      RS_max_TPS Currently computed TPS limit due to 
      RS_min_FPP Roadspeed min FPP command 
      rs_min_pw Enter the minimum pulse width. Pulses smaller than this will be 
      rejected and treated as noise. This value should be < 6.4us. Set this 
      parameter to zero to disable the noise cancellation feature. 
      RS_odom_total Vehicle total odometer distance 
      RS_OOA_state Roadspeed out of authority indicator (-1 = requesting less 
      power, +1 = requesting more power, 0 = in authority) 
      RS_pattern For typical evenly spaced pulse pattern sources, use the 
      'Uniform Non-Directional' setting. For coded wheel patterns to determine 
      direction of rotation, pick the appropriate pattern. Directional patterns 
      are typically used in conjunction with marine transmission output shaft 
      diagnostics to detect proper gear engagement. 
      RS_ppkm_Ulim This is an upper limit on the roadspeed pulse calibration 
      enforced if a Network Setpoint roadspeed pulse calibration is being used. 
      RS_prop_RS0 Proportional setpoint, speed low table value (These parameters 
      determine the linear transfer function between input voltage and roadspeed 
      limit setpoint.) 
      RS_prop_RS1 Proportional setpoint, speed high table value (These 
      parameters determine the linear transfer function between input voltage 
      and roadspeed limit setpoint.) 
      RS_prop_tau Proportional setpoint input low pass time constant (Lowpass 
      filter time constant to be applied to the incoming proportional voltage 
      source.) 
      RS_prop_V (Current lowpass filtered proportional roadspeed setpoint 
      voltage value for the roadspeed limit when in proportional setpoint mode.) 

      RS_prop_V0 Proportional setpoint, voltage low table value (These 
      parameters determine the linear transfer function between input voltage 
      and roadspeed limit setpoint.) 
      RS_prop_V1 Proportional setpoint, voltage high table value (These 
      parameters determine the linear transfer function between input voltage 
      and roadspeed limit setpoint.) 
      RS_pulses_per_km The calibration of the pulse input in number of pulses 
      per kilometer traveled. 
      RS_pulse_cnt Roadspeed rolling pulse accumulator. 
      RS_pulse_space This is the forced minimum dead-time between roadspeed 
      pulses. When a pulse is received, any pulses coming in during this time 
      duration afterward will be ignored. This acts as a false-pulse filter. The 
      user must be careful not to make this value too large since it can mask 
      actual high roadspeeds. In general, it should be no longer than 1/3 to 1/4 
      the minimum pulse spacing (maximum speed) that the vehicle can physically 
      experience. 
      rs_rise_trigger Roadspeed rising trigger level 
      RS_rpmtol_Ifrz If the roadspeed governor is in RPM control mode, this is 
      the +/- (positive) RPM error that will signal temporary freezing of the 
      roadspeed integrator until the inner RPM control loop is back in control. 
      This freezing only affects directional movement of the integrator that 
      would produce additional RPM error. 
      RS_rpm_nom Nominal speed at which roadspeed limiting occurs. 
      RS_setsrc This parameter determines the target roadspeed value when 
      "Roadspeed function" is set to one of the standard 'Enabled' modes.

      When set to 'Network Setpoint', the roadspeed setpoint is received from 
      the Sumitomo J1939 message.

      When set to 'Gov Switch State', the roadspeed setpoint is determined based 
      on the value of "Governor switch state":
      'None' - setpoint is 256 km/hr
      'Gov1' - setpoint is "Roadspeed setpoint lower-limit"
      'Gov2' - setpoint is "Roadspeed setpoint upper-limit"
      'Gov3' - setpoint is "Roadspeed setpoint default"
      Note: if "Max speed user setpoint - Primary" is not 'Disabled', then 
      "Governor switch state" is forced to 'None'. If a full-authority remote 
      TSC1 speed request is received, then "Governor switch state" is forced to 
      'Gov3'. Refer to the "Governor Select Input Configuration" section on the 
      Inputs worksheet to configure.

      When set to 'Gov1', the roadspeed setpoint is determined using Gov1 as an 
      auxiliary input. Parameter "Gov1 switch input function" must be set to 
      'Auxiliary Input' on the Inputs worksheet. When input is inactive, then 
      roadspeed setpoint is "Roadspeed setpoint default". When active, setpoint 
      is "Roadspeed setpoint lower-limit".

      When set to 'Gov2', behavior and configuration is the similar to 'Gov1'. 
      See 'Gov1' description above for details. 
      RS_setsrc_cfg Parameter determines the active logic state(s) for Gov1/Gov2 
      inputs when "Roadspeed setpoint source" is set to 'Gov1' or 'Gov2'. The 
      default value is equivalent to 'GND'. 
      RS_setsrc_ntwk When "Roadspeed setpoint source" is set to "Network 
      Setpoint", this selects which PGN sets the roadspeed limit.

      When "PGN 65473" is selected and the network roadspeed limit reception is 
      lost, the roadspeed limit is set to "'Roadspeed setpoint default" for the 
      remainder of the key cycle. When other options are selected and the 
      network roadspeed limit reception is lost, the roadspeed limit is set to 
      "'Roadspeed setpoint lower-limit".

      When "PGN 65450" is selected, the "J1939 PGN 65450 roadspeed setpoint 
      command receipt lost" diagnostic should be enabled. When other options are 
      selected, a "J1939 PGN timeout" diagnostic should be configured for the 
      selected PGN.

      When "PGN 62720" is selected, a PGN receipt timeout of 200ms will be 
      enforced. On Rx timeout, the "Roadspeed setpoint default" will be set for 
      the roadspeed limit. 
      RS_setsrc_stat Roadspeed setpoint source status 
      RS_setsrc_valid This switch allows an additional input other than the 
      proportional roadspeed setpoint voltage input itself to determine if the 
      proportional setpoint is used. For Toyota Forklifts, this is the slow PWM 
      input being present and valid. If the validation signal is enabled but not 
      present or invalid, then the proportional roadspeed setpoint input is 
      ignored and the system defaults to the fixed value setpoint. 
      RS_source SET1 Roadspeed control: Switch configures source for the ground 
      speed measurement. Flowchart normalized as RSP_source 
      RS_speed Current measured road speed according to the 
      RS_speed_CAN Current (measured) roadspeed, filtered for CAN transmission 
      RS_speed_CAN_tau Additional low-pass filter time constant for the road 
      speed measurement communicated via CAN messages. 
      RS_speed_d Desired roadspeed setpoint 
      RS_speed_Llim This is a lower roadspeed setpoint limit enforced if a 
      Network Setpoint roadspeed target is being used. It can also be the 
      roadspeed target if "Roadspeed setpoint source" is configured as 'Gov 
      Switch State', 'Gov1', or 'Gov2'. See "Roadspeed setpoint source" for more 
      details. 
      RS_speed_max Roadspeed control max speed limit if the setpoint source is 
      set to:
      - 'Fixed Value'
      - 'Aux * Proportional' and the input has an active fault condition
      - 'Gov Switch State' and "Gov switch state" has a value of 'Gov3'
      - 'Gov1' and Gov1 input is not active
      - 'Gov2' and Gov2 input is not active
      - 'Network Setpoint', "Roadspeed setpoint source network" is set to 'PGN 
      65473', and network roadspeed limit reception is lost 
      RS_speed_meas_acc current measured roadspeed in km/hr (32-bit low-pass 
      accumulated) 
      RS_speed_tau Lowpass filter time constant for the road speed 
      RS_speed_Ulim This is an upper roadspeed setpoint limit enforced if a 
      Network Setpoint roadspeed target is being used. It can also be the 
      roadspeed target if "Roadspeed setpoint source" is configured as 'Gov 
      Switch State'. See "Roadspeed setpoint source" for more details. 
      rs_TIF14_config Roadspeed T1F14 available 
      RS_TPS_bstld_crct When boost control mode is enabled, this parameter 
      determines whether the calculated boost load is limited by the roadspeed 
      maximum TPS governor when active.

      This parameter only applies to the 'Enabled - Limit Max Throttle' and 
      'Enabled - Limit Max + Cruise' roadspeed functions. 
      RS_TPS_FPPlim_ena This parameter determines whether the foot pedal 
      position is limited by the roadspeed maximum TPS governor when active.

      This parameter only applies to the 'Enabled - Limit Max Throttle' and 
      'Enabled - Limit Max + Cruise' roadspeed functions. 
      RS_TPS_lmt_ena Parameter determines whether the throttle position is 
      limited by the roadspeed maximum TPS governor. When set to 'Enabled', the 
      roadspeed maximum TPS governor will always limit the throttle position. 
      When set to 'Enabled - TSC1 Inactive', the throttle position will only be 
      limited when no full-authority TSC1 request is active.

      This parameter is only applicable when "DBW / IAC configuration" is set to 
      'DBW' on the DBW worksheet and when "Roadspeed function" is set to 
      'Enabled - Limit Max Throttle' or 'Enabled - Limit Max + Cruise' on the 
      Roadspeed worksheet.

      SCD_active_ms Start command detection: Command detection active timer 
      SCD_off_FB_volts If start command detection is active and the starter

      set to 'off'. 
      SCD_PWM_dc Specify the starter relay duty-cycle command to use while

      SD_ramp_ena If this switch is 'Enabled' and a fault shutdown request is 
      generated, the rev limit is slewed to idle (min governor setpoint) at the 
      rev limit engagement slew down rate. Once the idle setpoint is reached, 
      the engine will continue to idle for the 'idle wait' time before the

      secspd_actinv This diagnostic mode detects attempted activity by the user 
      on a secondary speed control system such as tap up/down, FPP2 based speed 
      control, etc... without valid conditions present for this type of control. 

      secspd_ena Secondary speed control mode selection via an independent input 
      determined by secspd_sw 
      secspd_FPP2act When the 'secondary speed control invalid activity' 
      diagnostic is 'Enabled', this value determines the detection sensitivity 
      of movement of the FPP2 input when FPP2 based speed control is an option. 
      A +/- change of more than this voltage level on FPP2 relative to the last 
      position of FPP2 when FPP2 speed control was actually valid and engaged 
      will trigger a fault. The comparison value for the last position is also 
      continuously low-passed to remove any drift effect. 
      secspd_FPP2trk FPP2 invalid activity reference level 
      secspd_FPP2trk_tau When the 'secondary speed control invalid activity' 
      diagnostic is 'Enabled', a low-pass filtered version of FPP2 is maintained 
      as a reference value for activity comparison. This reference value tracks 
      the actual FPP2 voltage without delay when FPP2 based control is valid and 
      engaged, but follows with this time constant once it is disengaged. This 
      eliminates drift over time for invalid activity comparisons. 
      secspd_sw This switch controls engagement of the secondary speed control 
      modes. See the discrete speed governor validation configuration comment 
      above for details on how this input is used for validating discrete-speed 
      governing. This input is also used for secondary foot pedal control. If 
      this switch is set to anything other than default: 

      1) If the BRAKE input is valid and FPP2 mode is set to speed control, this 
      input switches the active FPP mode between speed control and disabled.
      2) If this switch is set to default, the second foot pedal is controlled 
      only by the BRAKE input.

      ShftInt_actv_tmr Shift interrupt active timer 
      ShftInt_ena This switch selects the hardware input pin that controls 
      activation of the shift interrupt function. Active is assumed to be a 
      switch to ground. For the network option, a negative torque limit from a 
      J1939 TSC1 command will initiate this function. 
      ShftInt_FPPmax Shift interrupt will not be engaged above this FPP limit. 
      ShftInt_idle This is the idle target for the air valve control (DBW or 
      IAC) during active shift interrupt in 'switch-type' mode. 
      ShftInt_ignoret If the shift interrupt hardware input channel stays active 
      continuously for more than this timeout value, the input will be ignored 
      until it has gone inactive for at least this same amount of time. Set this 
      value to zero to disable this function. 
      ShftInt_Kspkret This is the spark retard gain value during active shift 
      interrupt in 'switch-type' mode. It is applied beyond any specified rpm 
      deadzone relative to the shift interrupt idle target, and is limited by 
      the maximum shift interrupt retard value. 
      ShftInt_revlim This is the fuel rev limit value during active shift 
      interrupt in 'switch-type' mode. It should in general be greater than or 
      equal to the idle target value. 
      ShftInt_revlim_drpm This is the proportional fuel rev limit band during 
      active shift interrupt in 'switch-type' mode. Between the 'fuel rev limit' 
      value and 'fuel rev limit' + 'delta-rpm' all cylinders will begin being 
      cut proportionally until they are all eliminated. Set this value to zero 
      to an instantaneous fuel cut at the 'fuel rev limit' value. 
      ShftInt_state Shift Interrupt State 
      SHIFT_active_wt Shift mechanical engagement delay timer. Set to nonzero 
      values when shift is requested. It beings decrementing when the shift 
      feedback voltage indicates gear engagement

      SHIFT_dt_LP Post interpolation low-pass filter constant for shift feedback 
      derivation calculation in fraction/ms. 
      SHIFT_dt_n Shift feedback derivative calculation linear least-squares 
      window. More points yields a quieter and more accurate derivative, but 
      introduces more time lag. Fewer points has the opposite effect. 
      SHIFT_ena Enables/disables ECM-based marine transmission shift control 
      using the dedicated SHIFT H-bridge for FNR solenoid or FNR stern drive 
      actuator options. The FNR solenoid option uses the SHIFT H-bridge as 2 
      high-side half-bridges with the '+' output for the forward solenoid and 
      the '-' output for the reverse solenoid.

      The desired gear setting should be sent via the ECI proprietary packet PGN 
      61189/61190 or from a VP EVC system for any of the options, or from a 
      marine throttle & gear handle for the FNR solenoid option only. 
      SHIFT_engage_delay Once the shift actuator feedback indicates that the 
      desired gear position has been achieved, this parameter indicates the 
      amount of time needed for the mechanical drive to fully engage. After 
      receiving a shift indication, the ECM will wait this amount of time before 
      re-engaging the throttle and any other actions taken during the shift 
      sequence.

      NOTE: The maximum engine speed and mechanical engagement delay values are 
      used anytime an ECI hand controller is present, even if shift actuator 
      control is disabled. This is for compatibility with systems that use the 
      ECI hand controller to control the shift solenoids. In this scenario, the 
      hand control packet gives the ECM a desired gear. The ECM will zero the 
      foot pedal command, and when the engine speed is below the max engine 
      shift speed, a countdown timer will begin to allow for the mechanical 
      engagement of the drive. The shift is assumed complete when the mechanical 
      delay timer expires, and actual gear = desired gear at this time (actual 
      gear is translated back to the ECI hand controller via an ETC2 message).

      SHIFT_FB_raw Marine shift feedback raw volts 
      SHIFT_fwd_delta Marine shift gear engage window - forward 
      SHIFT_fwd_raw Marine shift gear target voltage - forward 
      SHIFT_Ihard_lim Enter the maximum supported current draw on the ECM for 
      shift actuator support. The actuator nominal resistance and back-emf gain 
      are used to actively limit the current draw and avoid overcurrent and 
      over-temperature situations. This value should be large enough to shift 
      under all battery voltages and operating temperatures, yet low enough to 
      avoid engaging the on-board hardware overcurrent protection circuitry, 
      which currently engages at 20A. 
      SHIFT_intcirc_fail Shift actuator or drive circuit failure: The internal 
      circuitry protection will engage at >= 20A in an 
      overcurrent/short-to-ground situation and shut down the actuator drive 
      circuit for 100ms. This calibratable parameter specifies how many times 
      this sequence can occur within 1 key cycle before this fault will begin to 
      latch. 
      SHIFT_int_acc Marine shift shift integral accumulator 
      SHIFT_int_dt_frz The feedback error accumulator freeze rate. This value 
      should be relatively low for slow actuators to avoid large overshoots at 
      the endpoints of the control. Increase this value for faster convergence 
      to the desired setpoint, and decrease this value to help eliminate 
      overshoot at the forward/reverse endpoints of the actuator movement. 
      SHIFT_int_max The maximum integrator value. Note the negated value is used 
      for movements in the opposite direction. Smaller values prevent overshoot, 
      larger values yield faster response and better tracking. 
      SHIFT_Ipark_att Marine shift parking current attenuation 
      SHIFT_Ipark_dly Enter the delay before the parking current control will 
      engage. Allow ample time for shifts to complete under normal operating 
      conditions. 
      SHIFT_Ipark_ena Enables park current limiting control. During fault or 
      failure-to-achieve desired gear situations, the parking current control 
      reduces the actuator loading by limiting the PWM DC%. This feature should 
      not engage during normal operation and can be safely enabled to handle 
      fault situations. 
      SHIFT_Ipark_Ki Enter the current ramp rate to use for transitions into and 
      out of park current limiting control. 
      SHIFT_Ipark_lim Enter the maximum current limit for a prolonged 
      failure-to-achieve desired gear or stalled motor situation. This value 
      should be high enough to engage the drive under almost all normal 
      situations. It should also be low enough to limit actuator damage during 
      stalled motor situations. 
      SHIFT_Ipark_max_att Park current control limits the maximum PWM DC% sent 
      to the shift actuator. Enter the maximum allowed DC% reduction. If the DC% 
      reduction required to maintain the parking current exceeds this value, the 
      DC% will be increased (or decreased) to this value. When this happens, the 
      parking current may exceed the desired limit.

      SHIFT_Kp PID Kp gain for the shift actuator feedback error, translating a 
      raw A/D feedback error into a % duty-cycle. 
      SHIFT_K_emf This constant is used along with velocity to estimate the 
      back-emf and actuator current. The estimated actuator current is used to 
      limit the commanded duty-cycle and avoid the internal hardware overcurrent 
      limits.

      slowPWMin_DC The currently measured dutycycle of the slow PWM input 
      waveform. 
      slowPWMin_ena This switch selects which analog channel will be used (if 
      any) for measuring a low-bandwidth PWM signal period and duty-cycle. This 
      signal has a typical discretization of between 1ms and 2ms depending on 
      the primary/secondary analog input characteristics of the chosen channel 
      on the particular ECM. 
      slowPWMin_period The currently measured period of the slow PWM input 
      waveform. 
      slowPWMin_per_edge This switch determines how the incoming PWM waveform is 
      computed. For example, if rising edges are stable in time and falling 
      edges move to generate different duty-cycles, then select 
      'Rising-To-Rising Edge'. If only a frequency measurement is required, 
      select the edge with the sharpest transition (if one edge is sharper than 
      the other).

      SPKI_samp_raw spark current or diagnostic module feedback value 
      spkmon_min_dissipate Enter the required coil dissipation time between 2 
      consecutive current samples on a shared current sense line (see the 
      current monitoring selections to the right). A value of 0 disables this 
      additional wait time and only requires consecutive spark events not 
      overlap. 
      spko_cyl_dzfilt If enabled, the spark advance dead-zone and dead-zone tau 
      are used to slew in changes in cylinder-specific spark timing. See the 
      'Spark advance dead-zone' comments above for more details. 
      spko_cyl_mode Select the cylinder-specific spark advance offset mode. 
      spkret_decay_time This value is used to calculate the decay rate for the 
      spark retard modifier determined by the 'MAP-based Spark Retard' table. If 
      'Engine start spark retard' is set to "Enabled", the spark retard modifier 
      will be decayed back to 0 when the ECT-based hold time expires after 
      engine start. If 'FSO spark retard mode' is set to "Table Based", the 
      spark retard modifier applied after an FSO ON->OFF transition (fuel has 
      been turned back on) will be decayed back to 0 when the FSO time-based 
      hold time expires. 
      spkret_EGT Specifies the EGT temperature that must be exceeded before the 
      applied spark retard modifier is decayed back to 0 at engine start. This 
      parameter only applies when the ‘Engine start spark retard’ parameter is 
      set to “Enabled – ECT and EGT”. 
      spkret_hold_mult If the EGT sensor is not present or in a faulted state 
      when the ‘Engine start spark retard’ parameter is set to “Enabled – ECT 
      and EGT”, the ‘EGT spark retard decay threshold’ parameter is ignored and 
      only the ECT->Hold Time table is used to determine the spark retard 
      modifier hold duration at engine start. This multiplier is applied to the 
      table-based hold duration. Enter a value between 0 and 1. 
      spkret_hold_tmr The amount of time in seconds remaining for the active 
      engine start/fuel shutoff spark retard modifier, as shown in the 
      'Start/FSO Retard' parameter.

      spk_adv_base Base spark advance 
      spk_adv_crk Crank spark timing value 
      spk_adv_dz "Spark advance dead-zone": This parameter specifies a 
      cubic-rolloff deadzone for instantaneous changes in spark timing. Changes 
      in spark timing >= this value are instantaneously implemented. Changes in 
      spark timing < this value are slewed-in over the low-pass time constant, 
      spk_adv_dz_tau.

      spk_adv_OCTcomp The current octane compensated base spark advance for the 
      engine using linear interpolation between the lowoctane base spark advance 
      for the current fuel and the highoctane base spark advance from the 
      selected alternate table. The current octane rating determines the 
      weighting between these two values.

      spk_kill Spark kill command 
      spk_kill_CBT This is the maximum catalyst bed temperature allowed during a 
      spark kill test. Setting this value to zero permits any catalyst bed 
      temperature. 
      spk_kill_cyl This value displays the cylinder currently selected for spark 
      kill. 
      spk_kill_MAP This is the maximum manifold pressure allowed during a spark 
      kill test. Setting this value to zero permits any manifold pressure. 
      spk_kill_mfmode Enable/disable misfire detection spark during spark kill 
      spk_kill_mode This switch selects the spark kill mode. In single 
      continuous mode, the selected cylinder will misfire each cycle. In paired 
      continuous mode, the selected cylinder and the cylinder on the same 
      mechanical rotation segment but on the opposing revolution will misfire. 
      In evenly spaced random cylinder mode, spark kill will engage on on evenly 
      spaced spark events. In this mode, the initial spark kill is determined by 
      the 'Spark Kill Command' selection, while the 'Spark Kill Pct' variable 
      determines the spacing. 
      spk_kill_pct This value is only used when the spark kill mode is set to 
      evenly spaced cylinder. It determines how often a spark kill event is 
      induced. The percentage is calculated as the number of misfires vs. total 
      number of cylinder events. 
      spk_kill_rpm This is the maximum engine speed allowed during a spark kill 
      test. Setting this value to zero permits any engine speed. 
      spk_kill_tout This is the maximum continuous amount of time that a single 
      spark coil can remain killed during a spark kill test. After the timeout, 
      this test will be reset to off. Setting this value to greater than 60.0 
      seconds (i.e. 61.0 seconds) effectively disables this timeout.

      spk_ret_CWT CWT spark retard in CAD 
      spk_rpmlo_crank_ena Controls the 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' feature (see 
      below) for different fuel types.

      Disabled - Disables 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' feature for all fuel 
types.
      This has the same effect as setting 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' = 0.
      Gasoline Only - Enables the 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' value for gasoline 
      only.
      LP Only - Enables the 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' value for LP fuel type 
      only.
      NG Only - Enables the 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' value for NG fuel type 
      only.
      Gaseous Only - Enables the 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' value for gaseous 
      fuel types (LP + NG) only.
      Always enabled - Enables the 'Spark low-rpm crank limit' value for all 
      fuel types. 
      spk_rpmlo_crank_lmt Disables spark at engine speeds below this limit 
      during an aborted/failed crank attempt. Set this parameter to zero to 
      disable this feature. On port-injected engines, the fuel is simultaneously 
      disabled. On gaseous EPR-based applications, fuel delivery continues to 
      avoid potential lean-backfire situations on spin down.

      NOTE: If the cranking rpm 'Crank_rpm' is set below this rpm, it will cause 
      no-start cranking events in some configurations. 
      spk_rpmlo_stall_lmt Disables spark at engine speeds below this limit 
      during an engine stall situation. Set this parameter to zero to disable 
      this feature. On port-injected engines, the fuel is simultaneously 
      disabled. On gaseous EPR-based applications, fuel delivery continues to 
      avoid potential lean-backfire situations on spin down. 
      SPL_BM Parameter is the current average fuel correction for fast 
      single-point fuel learning. Fuel correction is sampled every 50ms and 
      filtered with a tau equal to one-seventh the value of the "Single-point 
      evaluation time". 
      SPL_BM_saved The previously saved average fuel correction for fast 
      single-point fuel learning. Fuel correction is from a previous engine 
      cycle that completed sampling in accordance with the "Single-point 
      evaluation time". 
      SPL_eval_tmr Parameter is the current evaluation timer value for fast 
      single-point fuel learning. 
      SPL_mon_state Parameter displays the current state for fast single-point 
      fuel learning.
      0 = 'Disabled' - feature disabled or active fuel type is not NG
      1 = 'Engine off' - engine not running
      2 = 'Waiting for warm up' - engine warming up
      3 = 'Waiting for stabilization' - waiting for operating conditions to 
      stabilize within SPL window
      4 = 'Sampling in progress' - stabilized, sampling and averaging fuel 
      correction
      5 = 'Sampling complete' - sampling complete, waiting for engine to shut 
      down before modifying NG AL table
      6 = 'Update in progress' - sampling complete, slewing to new NG AL table 
      while engine is running
      7 = 'Update complete' - NG AL table update is complete (update occurred 
      while engine was running) 
      SPL_NG_BM_delta Parameter specifies the change in fuel correction required 
      to trigger a single-point learn when "Single-point learn" is set to 
      'Enabled - Delta Fuel Correction'. The fuel correction only includes 
      adaptive and closed-loop block multipliers. If sampling completes in 
      accordance with the "Single-point evaluation time", then the sampled 
      average fuel correction will be evaluated in accordance with the 
      "Single-point learn update method". The average fuel correction is 
      compared against the stored average fuel correction from a previous engine 
      cycle. A fast single-point learn will occur when the following criteria 
      are satisfied:
      1). A copy of the adaptive learn table was saved on a previous engine 
      cycle.
      2). The absolute delta between the current fuel correction and previous 
      fuel correction is greater than this parameter.
      If criteria are met, then the adaptive learn table is overwritten with the 
      previously saved table and the difference between the current fuel 
      correction and previous fuel correction is added to every entry in the 
      adaptive learn table. 
      SPL_NG_BM_high Parameter specifies the threshold for an abnormally high 
      fuel correction and is only applicable when "Single-point learn" is set to 
      'Enabled - Absolute, Unidirectional' or 'Enabled - Absolute, 
      Bidirectional'. The fuel correction only includes adaptive and closed-loop 
      block multipliers. If sampling completes in accordance with the 
      "Single-point evaluation time", then the sampled average fuel correction 
      will be evaluated in accordance with the "Single-point learn update 
      method". If the average fuel correction is greater than this parameter, 
      then the fuel correction is considered abnormally high.

      A fast learn will occur when the following criteria are satisfied:
      1). Fuel correction is deemed abnormally high
      2). Fuel correction was previously deemed nominal
      3). A copy of the nominal adaptive learn table was previously saved
      If criteria are met, then the adaptive learn table is overwritten with the 
      nominal copy and the difference between the abnormally high fuel 
      correction and nominal fuel correction is added to every entry in the 
      adaptive learn table. 
      SPL_NG_BM_nominal Parameter specifies the threshold for a nominal fuel 
      correction and is only applicable when "Single-point learn" is set to 
      'Enabled - Absolute, Unidirectional' or 'Enabled - Absolute, 
      Bidirectional'. The fuel correction only includes adaptive and closed-loop 
      block multipliers. If sampling completes in accordance with the 
      "Single-point evaluation time", then the sampled average fuel correction 
      will be evaluated in accordance with the "Single-point learn update 
      method". If the average fuel correction is less than this parameter, then 
      the fuel correction is considered nominal.

      If the previous engine cycle and current engine cycle had nominal fuel 
      correction, then a copy of the adaptive learn table is stored for future 
      use. The copy of the table is only a copy and is not actively used or 
      updated while the engine is running. The copy is only updated at the end 
      of an engine cycle if the previously stated criteria are true.

      A fast learn will occur when the following criteria are satisfied:
      1). Fuel correction is deemed nominal
      2). Fuel correction was previously deemed abnormally high
      3). A copy of the nominal adaptive learn table was previously saved
      If criteria are met after engine shuts down, then the adaptive learn table 
      is overwritten with the nominal copy. If "Single-point learn" is set to 
      'Enabled - Absolute, Unidirectional', then no offset is added to the 
      nominal copy. If "Single-point learn" is set to 'Enabled - Absolute, 
      Bidirectional', then the difference between the measured fuel correction 
      and previously saved nominal fuel correction is added to every entry in 
      the adaptive learn table. 
      SPL_NG_ECT_min Parameter specifies the minimum engine coolant temperature 
      before single-point fuel learning can initiate. Only applicable when 
      "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_ena Parameter configures fast single-point NG fuel learning. If the 
      active fuel is not NG, then feature is disabled. When parameter is 
      enabled, fuel correction is sampled and averaged when the engine is 
      operating in a specified speed/MAP-load window and adaptive updates are 
      active. The averaged fuel correction only includes adaptive and 
      closed-loop block multipliers.

      When set to 'Enabled - Delta Fuel Correction': The average fuel correction 
      is compared against the stored average fuel correction from a previous 
      engine cycle. A copy of the adaptive learn table is always saved for 
      future use after sampling is complete.

      In 'Delta' mode, a fast single-point learn will occur when the following 
      criteria are satisfied:
      1). A copy of the adaptive learn table was saved on a previous engine 
cycle
      2). The absolute delta between the current fuel correction and previous 
      fuel correction is greater than the "Single-point fuel correction delta"
      If criteria are met, then the adaptive learn table is overwritten with the 
      previously saved table and the difference between the current fuel 
      correction and previous fuel correction is added to every entry in the 
      adaptive learn table.

      When set to 'Enabled - Absolute, Unidirectional' or 'Enabled - Absolute, 
      Bidirectional': The averaged fuel correction is compared against 
      nominal/high thresholds. If the previous engine cycle and current engine 
      cycle had nominal fuel correction, then a copy of the adaptive learn table 
      is stored for future use. 

      In 'Absolute' mode, a fast single-point learn will occur when the 
      following criteria are satisfied:
      1). Fuel correction is deemed abnormally high
      2). Fuel correction was previously deemed nominal
      3). A copy of the nominal adaptive learn table was previously saved
      If criteria are met, then the adaptive learn table is overwritten with the 
      nominal copy and the difference between the abnormally high fuel 
      correction and nominal fuel correction is added to every entry in the 
      adaptive learn table.

      A similar fast learn will occur when the following criteria are satisfied:
      1). Fuel correction is deemed nominal
      2). Fuel correction was previously deemed abnormally high
      3). A copy of the nominal adaptive learn table was previously saved
      If criteria are met, then the adaptive learn table is overwritten with the 
      nominal copy. If parameter is set to 'Enabled - Absolute, Unidirectional', 
      then no offset is added to the nominal copy. If parameter is set to 
      'Enabled - Absolute, Bidirectional', then the difference between the 
      measured fuel correction and previously saved nominal fuel correction is 
      added to every entry in the adaptive learn table. 
      SPL_NG_eval_time Parameter specifies the cumulative time that fuel 
      correction is sampled and averaged while within the single-point fuel 
      learning window. Only applicable when "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_MAPload_max Parameter specifies the maximum MAP-load for the 
      single-point fuel learning speed/MAP-load window. Only applicable when 
      "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_MAPload_min Parameter specifies the minimum MAP-load for the 
      single-point fuel learning speed/MAP-load window. Only applicable when 
      "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_rpm_max Parameter specifies the maximum engine speed for the 
      single-point fuel learning speed/MAP-load window. Only applicable when 
      "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_rpm_min Parameter specifies the minimum engine speed for the 
      single-point fuel learning speed/MAP-load window. Only applicable when 
      "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_run_min Parameter specifies the minimum engine run time before 
      single-point fuel learning can initiate. Only applicable when 
      "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_stable_time Parameter specifies the minimum time that the engine 
      must operate within the speed/MAP-load window before single-point fuel 
      learning can sample fuel correction. After engine conditions are 
      stabilized within the window, fuel correction is sampled and averaged for 
      the "Single-point evaluation time". If engine operating conditions fall 
      outside of the speed/MAP-load window, then sampling is halted and engine 
      conditions must stabilize again before sampling can resume. Only 
      applicable when "Single-point learn" is enabled. 
      SPL_NG_update_mode Parameter determines when a single-point fuel learn is 
      executed. When set to 'After engine stops', then a single-point fuel learn 
      will occur after sampling is complete and engine stops. When set to 
      'Immediate', then a single-point fuel learn will occur immediately after 
      sampling is complete. Any adjustments to the adaptive learn table will be 
      slewed using the "Single-point learn update rate". 
      SPL_NG_update_rate Parameter specifies the slew rate for updates to the 
      adaptive learn table during a single-point learn while the engine is 
      running. Parameter is only applicable when "Single-point learn update 
      method" is set to 'Immediate'. Each point in the adaptive table is slewed 
      independently to their desired learned value. If engine stops before 
      slewing is complete, then the adaptive table will immediately be updated 
      with the final table values.

      SPN_3344_ena Parameter determines if SPN 3344 is reported in EC1 as well 
      as if the engine torque curve reports static or dynamic speed/torque 
      points in EC1.
      When set to 'Disabled - Static Points', SPN 3344 is not present and a 
      static (legacy) set of speed/torque curve points is reported.
      When set to 'Enabled - Static Points', SPN 3344 is present and a static 
      (legacy) set of speed/torque curve points is reported.
      When set to 'Enabled - Dynamic Points', SPN 3344 is present and a dynamic 
      set of speed/torque curve points with active derates applied is reported.
      When set to 'Disabled - Dynamic Points', SPN 3344 is not present and a 
      dynamic set of speed/torque curve points with active derates applied is 
      reported.
      When set to 'Disabled - Dynamic, No TSC1', SPN 3344 is not present and a 
      dynamic set of speed/torque curve points with active derates applied is 
      reported. However, active TSC1 speed and torque limits are removed.
      When set to 'Enabled - Dynamic, No TSC1', SPN 3344 is present and a 
      dynamic set of speed/torque curve points with active derates applied is 
      reported. However, active TSC1 speed and torque limits are removed.
      When set to 'Disabled - Dynamic, Improved', SPN 3344 is not present and a 
      dynamic set of speed/torque curve points with active derates applied is 
      reported. The accuracy of torque values is improved by calculating the 
      derate for each point versus using the current derate which is only valid 
      at the current engine speed.
      When set to 'Enabled - Dynamic, Improved', SPN 3344 is present and a 
      dynamic set of speed/torque curve points with active derates applied is 
      reported. The accuracy of torque values is improved by calculating the 
      derate for each point versus using the current derate which is only valid 
      at the current engine speed. 

      NOTE: SPN 3344 always reports a 10ms TSC1 rate. This setting also controls 
      the torque percentages reported for ISO 15031-5 PID 0x64 / ISO 14229 DID 
      0xF464 - "Engine Percent Torque Data".

      For dynamic points, the application of active derates to torque points is 
      configurable through the "J1939 torque / engine load conversion" parameter 
      on the Estimators worksheet. Derates are in units of engine load 
      percentage and need to be converted to a net torque percentage.

      SRVC_fixed_interval This is the default fixed service interval used when 
      "Service notification mode" is set to "Fixed Interval (hours)". The 
      service interval must be >= 1.0 hours (for this fixed value and for the 
      table entries below). 
      SRVC_fixed_int_km_L1 This is the service interval used for the 'Service 
      Interval Expired - Level 1' diagnostic when "Service notification mode" is 
      set to "Fixed Interval (kms)". The service interval is in increments of 5 
      km and must be >= 5 km. 
      SRVC_fixed_int_km_L2 This is the service interval used for the 'Service 
      Interval Expired - Level 2' diagnostic when "Service notification mode" is 
      set to "Fixed Interval (kms)". The service interval is in increments of 5 
      km and must be greater than or equal to the level 1 service interval. 
      SRVC_km_rem Distance which can be traveled before the 'Service Interval 
      Expired - Level 1' diagnostic becomes active. When the value is negative, 
      the level 1 service interval has passed. 
      SRVC_mode Enables the service notification feature.

      If "Fixed Interval (hours)" is selected, the 'Service Interval Expired - 
      Level 1' fault will set after the number of operating hours specified 
      below.

      If "Speed/Load Based" is selected, the service interval is weighted by the 
      number of hours specified at the current operating condition. For example, 
      spending 5 hours at an operating condition with a 5 hour service interval 
      will result in the service interval remaining dropping from 100% to 90%.

      If "Fixed Interval (kms)" is selected, the 'Service Interval Expired - 
      Level 1' fault and the 'Service Interval Expired - Level 2' fault will set 
      after the respective distances have passed.

      strt_add cold start fuel adder in fraction 
      strt_ECT_lmt The minimum engine coolant temperature required to exit the 
      warm-up phase. If coolant temperature is faulted, then coolant temperature 
      check is bypassed. Only applicable when "Starting initial speed mode" is 
      set to 'ECT Table-Based + Warm Up'. 
      strt_fuel_off Any cranking fuel is attenuated to zero as the engine speed 
      initially accelerates from 'Run Speed' to this speed linearly. Once the 
      engine reaches this speed, all cranking fuel is eliminated. 
      strt_idle_dcy initial starting idle speed (flare) decay rate in rpm/ms 
      strt_idle_hld initial starting idle speed (flare) hold time in [16.0] ms 
      strt_idle_ini initial starting idle speed (flare) in rpm 
      strt_idle_mode This switch determines the mode of operation for the 
      initial starting idle speed parameters.

      The legacy 'Single-Point / Zero-Hold' mode is a single-point initial speed 
      with no hold time and a single-point ramp-rate.

      The 'ECT Table-Based' mode is an ECT-based schedule for the initial speed, 
      hold time, and ramp rate.

      The 'ECT Table-Based + Warm Up' mode is also an ECT-based schedule for the 
      initial speed, hold time, and ramp rate. However, additional warm-up 
      criteria must be satisfied before ramping. The oil temperature must be 
      greater than the "Warm-up phase min oil temp" and engine coolant 
      temperature greater than the "Warm-up phase min ECT". If a warm-up 
      override start request is received, the hold time and warm-up criteria 
      will be bypassed completely. Furthermore, the ramp rate will be multiplied 
      by the "Warm-up override ramp-rate multiplier" to reach the target 
      governor speed faster.

      A warm-up override start request is defined as the reception of ECI PGN 
      42351 with a crank request (bits 3-4 in SPN 65393) and a warm-up override 
      request (bits 7-8 in SPN 65393). 
      strt_idle_state The start initial speed state 
      strt_ign_rpm The "Cranking Ignition Timing" table is used up to this speed 
      on starts. Note that a run-mode transition according to the 'Run RPM' 
      takes precedence over this value for switching to run-mode spark timing. 
      In addition, any "Crank Timing Decay" value looked-up versus CHT will 
      cause a linear decay from the crank timing value toward normal spark 
      timing. 
      strt_inj_mode_I1 For primary injection operation, set this switch to 
      'Single-Point' to utilize the single value injection timing below during 
      crank only (legacy). Set this switch to 'CHT Table Based' to utilize the 
      after-start table injection timing and decay calibration - this 
      table-based value will take full effect during cranking and decay during 
      after-start. 
      strt_inj_mode_I2 For secondary injection operation, set this switch to 
      'Single-Point' to utilize the single value injection timing below during 
      crank only (legacy). Set this switch to 'CHT Table Based' to utilize the 
      after-start table injection timing and decay calibration - this 
      table-based value will take full effect during cranking and decay during 
      after-start. 
      strt_inj_rpm The cranking injection timing value is used up to this speed 
      on starts. 
      strt_inj_tmng Injection timing used during cranking when in primary 
      injection mode until the "Crank injection timing rpm limit" is reached. 
      CAD BBDCI refers to CAD before BDC intake (end of intake). 
      strt_inj_tmng_I2 Injection timing used during cranking when in secondary 
      injection mode until the "Crank injection timing rpm limit" is reached. 
      CAD BBDCI refers to CAD before BDC intake (end of intake). 
      strt_max_FPP Values < 100% limit the maximum throttle position during 
      crank. This value is ignored during fuel clear requests. 
      strt_min_FPP Start minimum FPP 
      strt_min_idle Parameter is only applicable when "Starting initial speed 
      mode" is set to 'Single-Point / Zero-Hold'. 
      strt_min_idle_dcy Parameter is only applicable when "Starting initial 
      speed mode" is set to 'Single-Point / Zero-Hold'. Parameter is only 
      applied when ramping down to a target speed. Ramping up to a higher speed 
      has no slewing. 
      strt_mult cold start fuel multiplier in fraction 
      strt_no_warmup Indicator that a warm-up override start request was 
      received and warm-up phase will be bypassed. 
      strt_no_warmup_mult When a warm-up override start request is received, the 
      calculated ramp rate from the ECT table is multiplied by this parameter to 
      effectively increase the ramp rate. Parameter is only applicable when 
      "Starting initial speed mode" is configured as 'ECT Table-Based + Warm 
      Up'. Value must be greater than or equal to 1.

      A warm-up override start request is defined as the reception of ECI PGN 
      42351 with a crank request (bits 3-4 in SPN 65393) and a warm-up override 
      request (bits 7-8 in SPN 65393). 
      strt_OILT_lmt The minimum oil temperature required to exit the warm-up 
      phase. If oil temperature is disabled or faulted, then oil temperature 
      check is bypassed. Only applicable when "Starting initial speed mode" is 
      set to 'ECT Table-Based + Warm Up'. 
      strt_spkret_ena If enabled, a spark retard modifier is applied at engine 
      start based on the 'MAP-based Spark Retard' table. The spark retard 
      modifier is updated based on changing MAP load values and applied for the 
      duration of time specified by the 'Engine Start Spark Retard Hold' table. 
      Once the hold time expires, the spark retard modifier is decayed back to 0 
      at a rate calculated from the 'Spark retard decay time' parameter.

      swap_crank_cam If this option is enabled, the crank signal should be wired 
      to the cam1 input pins on the header, and the cam sensor should be wired 
      to the crank input on the header. All calibration values are still applied 
      normally (i.e. setup the crank input calibration for the actual crank 
      sensor, and setup the cam1 calibration for the cam sensor). 
      SWARNblk_off A soft warning may cause a continuous output activation or a 
      blinking/pulsing output. The on/off times specify this behavior. For a 
      continuously on output in an active state, simply set the offtime to zero 
      and the ontime to any value. 
      SWARNblk_on A soft warning may cause a continuous output activation or a 
      blinking/pulsing output. The on/off times specify this behavior. For a 
      continuously on output in an active state, simply set the off time to zero 
      and the on time to any value. 
      SWARNblk_open_off Soft warning open-output transfer Blink/Pulse off-time 
      (ms) 
      SWARNblk_open_on Soft warning open-output transfer Blink/Pulse on-time 
      (ms) 
      SWARNchan_open This switch controls which output pin will be actuated when 
      a soft warning is triggered and the normal soft-warning output is detected 
      to be open. If the MIL, soft, and hard warning channels are set or 
      transferred to the same output, MIL functionality receives the highest 
      priority and soft warning functionality receives the lowest priority. 
      SWARNfcn Soft warning function status (Disconnected, Idle off, MIL, Hard 
      warning, Soft warning, Audible alert) 
      SWARNout_mirror Soft warning output pin 
      SWARN_bulbchk This is the time that the soft warning output will remain on 
      following an initial keyon/engine stopped event to allow the operator to 
      observe that the output (bulb) is functioning. 
      SWARN_bulbon Soft Warning Output Bulp-Check Config - Determines whether 
      the warning output will be continuously on or blinked/pulsed during the 
      key-on bulb check period. 
      SWARN_chan This switch controls which output pin will be actuated when a 
      soft warning is triggered. A selection of 'None' will not control an 
      output pin, but will continue to communicate a soft warning over the 
      various communications links. In particular, the J1939 'Warn' lamp 
      indication will be on during an active soft warning condition. If the soft 
      and hard warning channels are set to the same output, hard warning 
      functionality (blinking or continuous) takes precedence during an active 
      hard warning. 
      SWARN_lamp Output lamp associated with softwarning faults.

      TAUX_LP_tau Auxiliary temperature low-pass filter time constant 
      TBI_fuel_calc This switch is used to define the fueling calculation 
      strategy used for throttle body fuel introduction applications.
      When specific MAP faults are enabled and faulted, the fueling calculation 
      strategy is automatically switched from 'Throttle Model Based' to 
      'Speed-density + dMAP'. Refer to "Fuel mode MAP fault reaction" on the 
      'DiagConfig' worksheet for more details. 
      TBI_tran_DCstrt_max At high injector duty-cycles, the transient fueling 
      compensation will not provide much benefit. This parameter keeps the 
      transient fueling compensation disengaged if the injector duty-cycle is 
      high. 
      TBI_tran_ena Transient throttle-body fueling enable: This feature is 
      intended to provide transient fueling compensation for synchronous 
      throttle-body injection applications. It is primarily used on natural gas 
      injection block systems. 
      TBI_tran_engage_cnt TBI transient fuel engage count 
      TBI_tran_extrap_in Obsoleted parameter 
      TBI_tran_extrap_out Obsoleted parameter 
      TBI_tran_injmin_DC Minimum TBI injector duty cycle 
      TBI_tran_injon_DC Total TBI injector duty cycle 
      TBI_tran_injon_num Total number of throttle body injectors active 
      TBI_tran_inj_minon At low flow rates, the 5ms period used for computing 
      TBI transient fueling will be increased in order to maintain this minimum 
      injector on-time. This injector on-time references the actual injector 
      minimum, and not the average PW before TBI transient fueling engages. 
      TBI_tran_inj_turnoff For transient throttle-body fueling compensation, the 
      injector off time is assumed constant. The injector turn-on time is 
      assumed to be the sum of the injector turn-off time and the calibrated 
      injector offset, since the injector offset is turn-on time - turn off 
      time. Note that for current-controlled injection systems, the turn-off 
      time will actually increase with increasing system while the turn-on time 
      will decrease with increasing system voltage. 
      TBI_tran_MAPdt_off Obsoleted parameter 
      TBI_tran_MAPdt_on Obsoleted parameter 
      TBI_tran_min_MAP Transient throttle-body injection will not engage if MAP 
      is below this limit. If MAP drops below this limit while TBI transient 
      injection is disabled, it will disengage. 
      TBI_tran_min_rpm This prevents engagement during spin-down and avoids 
      issues associated with very long time intervals between injection events. 
      TBI_tran_off_validms Obsoleted parameter 
      TBI_tran_off_validwt Obsoleted parameter 
      TBI_tran_off_wt_ms Once the disengagement conditions have been satisfied, 
      the transient fueling compensation will remain engaged for at least this 
      amount of time. 
      TBI_tran_PWpct_neg If the high-passed fuel PW goes below this value 
      (high-pass = raw value - low-passed value, where the raw-value is 
      pre-filtered), then TBI transient fueling is engaged. 
      TBI_tran_PWpct_off Once engaged, if the high-passed PW goes below this 
      value for the disengagement validation wait period, TBI transient fueling 
      will be disengaged. 
      TBI_tran_PWpct_pos If the high-passed fuel PW exceeds this value 
      (high-pass = raw value - low-passed value, where the raw-value is 
      pre-filtered), then TBI transient fueling is engaged. 
      TBI_tran_PW_dev Pulse-width steady state deviation 
      TBI_tran_PW_HPtau The average pulse-width PW_avg is pre-filtered, and then 
      used in a high-pass filter to determine if TBI transient fueling should be 
      engaged. This value is the high-pass filter time constant. 
      TBI_tran_PW_LPtau The average pulse-width PW_avg is pre-filtered, and then 
      used in a high-pass filter to determine if TBI transient fueling should be 
      engaged. This value is the pre-filter time constant. 
      TBI_tran_PW_prefilt Low-passed fueling pulse-width 
      TBI_tran_runtime_wt This wait period is intended to avoid engagement 
      during startup transient conditions. 
      TBI_tran_state Transient throttle-body status 
      TBI_tran_tcyl_min If the time between cylinder events is less than this 
      value, the throttle-body transient fueling compensation will not engage, 
      and if it is engaged, it will automatically disengage. Note the 
      compensation takes place at 5ms intervals, so attempting to run 
      throttle-body transient injection compensation at small intervals will 
      have a small effect on performance. This time can be set < 5.0 ms, 
      however, since the transient fueling compensation does exit synchronous 
      injection mode and allow simultaneous firing of all injectors (i.e. on a 
      6-cylinder engine with 5ms between cylinder events, it will take 30ms to 
      turn on all injectors during a hard tip-in without transient fueling 
      compensation engaged).

      Tcambmp_auto During an impending cam fault auto-unlocking procedure, this 
      switch enables 'phase 3' of the strategy called the 'bump' procedure. This 
      phase sends a single (usually) high-current long-duration pulse to the cam 
      actuator to attempt to 'unstick' it and return normal operation. If 
      enabled, this phase is initiated at 75% of the fault counter latch time 
      following the phase 1 starting-current pulse and the phase 2 'rattle' 
      pulses. 
      Tcambmp_dur This is the total pulse time for the 'Cam-Bump' maintenance 
      procedure. If this procedure is initiated by a technician, a current pulse 
      of the specified duration and current will be sent to the variable-cam 
      actuator of the engine (if so equipped) in order to attempt to release a 
      'stuck' cam phaser. This test can only be run once per key-cycle and is 
      subject to the rpm limit below. NOTE: To prevent this test from ever 
      running, set the duration to zero. 
      Tcambmp_I This is the current level to be used during the 'Cam-Bump' 
      procedure pulse as described in more detail above. 
      Tcambmp_keyon This switch forces a 'cam-bump' current of 'Tcambmp_I' amps 
      for a duration of 'Tcambmp_dur' ms during a key-on/engine-stopped 
      condition before the engine begins to rotate. If the engine rotates this 
      pulse is immediately terminated. 
      Tcambmp_rpm_max The engine speed must be less than this value in order to 
      run the 'Cam-Bump' procedure described above.

      = -200 %/s, the actuator is about to impact the closed-stop, and the min 
      PS PSdt parameter is -100 %/s, then for a Kd value of 1.0 %/%*sec, the

      TCSB_max_TPSdt dPS/dt value at the max PS (full-closed plus closed-stop PS 
      delta) position above which no braking action will occur. This must be a 
      value strictly < 0 and should be more negative than the min PS PSdt value.

      between the surge % at low pressure ratios and idle, and the choke % at 
      high pressure ratios and full-load.

      TC_comp_Npct Compressor corrected turbocharger speed in percent of 
      reference speed 
      TC_comp_Nr This is the reference speed used for the compressor model. This 
      parameter should scale inversely with the compressor exducer diameter. 
      Adjust this parameter to achieve rough agreement between the turbo speed 
      model and measured turbo speed. Fine-tuning of the turbo speed model 
      requires adjustment of the "Compressor Corrected Speed" 2D table. 
      TC_comp_Pratio Compressor Pressure ratio 
      TC_comp_Pratio_min The entries in the turbocharger model 1D tables may 
      contain pressure ratios near 1.0. A minimum surge pressure ratio is used 
      to ensure the surge Pratio limit is set to a reasonable value. The final 
      surge pressure ratio limit will be >= this value. 
      TC_comp_Pref This is the reference pressure used for the compressor 
      corrected flow and speed computations. Most compressor maps correct to

      corrected flow and speed computations. Most compressor maps correct to

      use in the heat transfer estimation. It is typically set to a large value 
      due to the long time constants associated with turbo heat transfer. 
      TC_mdot_nom Heat transfer model: Turbo heat transfer reference flow 
      TC_mech_eta The mechanical efficiency determines how much of the turbine 
      work is available to the compressor. It accounts for bearing losses, etc.

      TC_N_mode Note that not all pulse/roadspeed inputs are capable of turbo 
      speed measurement. The ECM PC display shows if this feature is available 
      on a particular ECM platform. If turbo speed is estimated, the 2D table 
      with compressor mass flow and compressor pressure ratio is used to 
      estimate (temperature and pressure corrected) turbo speed. 
      TC_N_pulses_rev Note this divisor is only applied to the measured (not 2D 
      table estimated) turbo speed. 
      TC_N_PWM_edge Turbo speed edge capture (Rising or Falling edge) 
      TC_N_PWM_periods Enter the number of PWM periods to use for turbo speed 
      measurement. Lower values result in faster sensor response, higher values 
      minimize the measurement jitter. This value must be >= 1. 
      TC_N_tau Low-pass filter time constant in ms for the turbo speed 
      measurement. Note this low-pass filter is applied to measured and 
      estimated turbo speeds.

      TC_turb_etamin This parameter places a lower-limit on the turbine 
      efficiency. It is used to protect against <= 0 turbine efficiencies, which 
      can happen if the speed-based turbine efficiency correction reduces the 
      efficiency significantly. This should be set to a reasonable, non-zero 
      value.

      TC_turb_mdot0c_pct The fully-closed 0% WGA turbine corrected flow is 
      roughly independent of turbine pressure ratio and corrected speed. 
      Therefore, the flow rate for this condition is fixed at this % of the 
      turbine reference flow rate, and independent of the 2D full-open flow 
      table.

      measured, this value may be used to calibration the turbine flow tables 
      TC_turb_mdotr Turbine reference (corrected) mass flow rate 
      TC_turb_mdotr_pct This is the reference flow rate used for the turbine 
      model. This parameter should scale as the square root of the turbine 
      inducer diameter. If a turbine map is not available, set this parameter 
      equal to 40-75% of the compressor reference flow.

      This parameter should scale inversely with the turbine inducer diameter. 
      If a turbine map is not available, set this parameter to 45-60% of the 
      compressor reference speed. 
      TC_turb_Pratio Turbine Pressure Ratio 
      TC_turb_Pref This is the reference pressure used for the turbine corrected 
      flow and speed computations. Most compressor maps correct to 13.95 psi,

      TEI_BP_hi_on If zero, TEI is fully disengaged for MAP < BP and fully 
      engaged (provided the other enabling conditions were fully satisfied) for 
      MAP >= BP. A nonzero value here modifies the fully-enabled pressure 
      setpoint. 
      TEI_BP_lo_off If zero, TEI is fully disengaged for MAP < BP and fully 
      engaged (provided the other enabling conditions were fully satisfied) for 
      MAP >= BP. A nonzero value here modifies the fully-disabled pressure 
      setpoint. 
      TEI_EGR_minnom Current TEI EGR min/nom select 
      TEI_enable TEI current enable factor. This values ramps as TEI time 
      requirements expire or reset. 
      TEI_enrich The current TEI enrichment in % of the current phi setpoint 
      relative to 0.65 nominal phi Enrichment relative to nominal 0.65 phi means 
      that as the base phi setpoint moves closer to stoich (1.00 phi) the 
      enrichment will be linearly decreased to 0%, and at 0.65 base phi the 
      enrichment will be exactly the value indicated as a multiplier.

      Example:
      10% enrichment commanded at 0.650 phi base = 0.715 phi,
      10% enrichment commanded at 1.000 phi base = 1.000 phi. 
      TEI_FPP_dz When TEI goes into reset mode (TEI off) after a TEI 
      enrichment/retard boost-ramp cycle, TEI will remain off until the driver 
      changes his load demand to the engine. This value is applied as a +/- 
      tolerance to detect this transition. 
      TEI_full_t When TEI initiates, this is the amount of time that it will 
      allow up to 100% of its current enrichment/retard spans. 
      TEI_max_enrich The maximum enrichment in % of the current phi setpoint 
      relative to 0.65 nominal phi that will be generated during fully-enabled 
      TEI conditions with TIP droop >= TIP span (including the TIP dead-zone). 
      Enrichment relative to nominal 0.65 phi means that as the base phi 
      setpoint moves closer to stoich (1.00 phi) the enrichment will be linearly 
      decreased to 0%, and at 0.65 base phi the enrichment will be exactly the 
      value indicated as a multiplier.

      Example:
      10% enrichment commanded at 0.650 phi base = 0.715 phi,
      10% enrichment commanded at 1.000 phi base = 1.000 phi. 
      TEI_max_retard The maximum spark retard that will be generated during 
      fully-enabled TEI conditions with TIP droop >= TIP span (including the TIP 
      dead-zone). 
      TEI_mode Enable/disable TEI mode.
      In spark/fuel mode, TEI is used to richen the target phi and retard spark 
      during turbo boost spool-up conditions. In EGR min/nom mode, TEI selects 
      between the minimum and nominal EGR command and spark tables (operating on 
      the minimum table will build boost more quickly, due to retarded spark 
      timing and a closed EGR valve). 
      TEI_reset_t After completion of a fully-enabled/transition time, this is 
      the minimum time required with TEI enrichment/retard off before allowing 
      any additional TEI events. The reset time may be extended if the driver 
      does not change his load demand according to the load demand dead-zone 
      value. 
      TEI_retard Current TEI spark retard 
      TEI_rpm_lower At engine speeds below this value, TEI is fully active. As 
      engine speed rises above this value toward the fully-disabled speed, TEI 
      is linearly decayed. Fully-enabled speed must be < fully-disabled speed. 
      TEI_rpm_upper At engine speeds above this value, TEI is fully disabled. As 
      engine speed falls below this value toward the fully-enabled speed, TEI is 
      linearly increased. Fully-enabled speed must be < fully-disabled speed. 
      TEI_state TEI state 
      TEI_timer TEI timer 
      TEI_TIP_dz This the dead-zone below the TIP target where all TEI action 
      will come to a stop. Any TIP droop below this dead-zone does not include 
      this dead-zone in its span. 
      TEI_TIP_span The delta-psi from the boost TIP target minus the TEI TIP 
      deadzone at which TEI enrichment/retard will be at their maximum values. 
      TEI_total_pct TEI total engagement (percent) 
      TEI_trans_t After the TEI fully-enabled time expires, this is the slew 
      time that TEI will use to ramp out enrichment/retard. It is also the time 
      used to ramp back in during repeated (chained) TEI requests.

      TIPAdapt_cmd_mstr Master TPS requested

      TIPAdapt_correction TPS % adaptive correction 
      TIPAdapt_deadzone The difference between MAP raw and MAP filtered must be 
      more than the deadzone before the adaptive table will be updated. 
      TIPAdapt_dMAP_max MAP delta max is the maximum difference between the raw 
      MAP value and the low passed MAP value allowable to update the adaptive 
      correction table. If the difference is greater than this value, then the 
      engine is not considered stable enough to allow changes to the adaptive 
      algorithm, i.e., the MAP is going through a transient change. 
      TIPAdapt_ECT_min The minimum ECT value is used as a stability criterion. 
      Both the Master ECM and Slave ECM must report an ECT above this minimum 
      before the adaptive table will be updated. This helps ensure both sides of 
      the engine have entered a stable state. 
      TIPAdapt_ECT_mstr Master ECT 
      TIPAdapt_ECT_slv Slave ECT 
      TIPAdapt_ena Multi-ECM MAP based slave throttle control updates a MAPxRPM 
      adaptive table with the error correction to be applied to the calculated 
      Master ECM TIP value used by the Slave ECM to calculate the related TPS % 
      used to match the Master MAP value.

      The correction is based on the difference between the Master ECM MAP and 
      the Slave ECM MAP:

      error = Master MAP - Slave MAP
      correction = TIP Adapt Gain x error x delta T (loop time)

      Adaptive learning does not take place during transient states. If the 
      filtered MAP value deviates from the raw MAP value by more than a 
      configurable difference, then learning is temporarily disabled until the 
      difference is within tolerance for at least the stabilization time.

      Adaptive learning will not take place if the error (Master/Slave MAP 
      difference) is less than the dead zone limit.

      ECT must be reached and/or exceeded before adaptive learning will be 
      updated.

      MAP and RPM must be within limits before adaptive learning will be 
      updated.

      TIPAdapt_updating Indicates when adaptive table is actively updating 
      TIPAdapt_wait The TIP transient wait time is the amount of time to wait 
      after the difference between raw MAP and filtered MAP comes back into an 
      acceptable range following a transient event. Once this timer has expired, 
      the adaptive table will be allowed to be updated.

      sonic. For example, when engine is idling with low load, the estimated TIP 
      may be below barometric pressure. Use option 'Throttle model - corrected' 
      to properly estimate TIP when flow is sonic. 
      TIP_est_tau Time constant for estimated throttle inlet pressure's 
      (TIP_est) low-pass filter. 
      TIP_flts_def_mode Parameter determines which TIP faults can cause TIP 
      sensor value to be overridden with the default value. When set to 
      'Standard Faults', the following fault are checked:
      "TIP/TOP low voltage" fault
      "TIP/TOP high voltage" fault
      "TIP/TOP active" fault
      At least one fault must be active-latched to override the TIP sensor value 
      with the default value.

      When set to 'Standard + TIP Pegging Offset Fault', the "TIP pegging offset 
      out-of-range" fault is also checked. This fault must be potential or 
      confirmed and active to override the TIP sensor value with the default 
      value. 
      TIP_flt_fuel_mode Parameter determines the fuel calculation whenever a TIP 
      sensor fault is active-latched and causing the default TIP value to be 
      used. When set to 'Speed-Density + dMAP/dt', the active fuel calculation 
      is automatically switched to 'Speed-Density + dMAP/dt' when the TIP 
      default value is being used due to an active-latched TIP sensor fault. The 
      applicable TIP sensor faults are determined by the "TIP faults that set 
      TIP to default" parameter. The overridden fuel calculation modes are the 
      "Throttle-body injection fuel mode" and "CFV fuel calculation mode".
      This parameter is only applicable when:
      "TIP/TOP source" is not 'Estimated' on the Inputs worksheet
      "Boost control type" is 'Turbocharged' on the Boost worksheet 
      TIP_gauge_def Default TIP gauge pressure used in Intake Flow rate model 
      TIP_global_filt This switch selects what type of general global filter 
      scheme is used for the TIP signal in most modes of operation. The 
      'Default' setting uses standard low-pass filtering. The 'Cylinder 
      Windowed' mode uses a sliding engine synchronous window averaging 
      technique. Refer to "MAP/TIP Cylinder Window Calculation" section for 
      configuration. Note that 'Throttle-Model Base Throttle-Body Fueling' 
      always uses cylinder windowing regardless of this switch setting.

      condition 
      TIP_maxv TIP/TOP high voltage diagnostic: TIP/TOP voltage upper limit

      TIP_minv TIP/TOP low voltage diagnostic: TIP/TOP voltage lower limit 
      threshold 
      TIP_raw TIP raw volts 
      TIP_slow Slow time constant version of TIP (LPF time constant of LP_slow) 
      TIP_windowed High speed cylinder event windowed TIP value 
      TIP_windowed_def Specifies the default value for the cylinder-event 
      windowed throttle inlet pressure (TIP_windowed) when the TIP sensor is 
      faulted or not available. When set to 'Enabled', the method specified by 
      "TIP default" is applied to both TIP and TIP_windowed.

      TMtf_PRov_max See the comments for 'Lower PR override' above. 
      TMtf_PRov_min The pressure-ratio (PR) is defined as MAP/TIP.
      As PR approaches 1.0, the compressible flow solution through the throttle 
      becomes poorly conditioned. This is because at PR near 1.0, MAP and TIP 
      are very close to the same value and small errors in the measurement of 
      either one produce very large air flow estimate changes.
      The 'Lower PR override' and 'Upper PR override' values provide a way to 
      discontinue utilization of the flow estimate from the throttle-model 
      algorithm as PR approaches 1.0.
      Instead, speed density and dMAP/dt manifold filling are used during these 
      conditions.When PR <= 'Lower PR override' then the rest of the system is 
      free to use the throttle-model based port flow and transient flow estimate 
      as required.When PR >= 'Upper PR override' then the reset of the system is 
      only allowed to use speed-density for port flow and dMAP/dt for transient 
      flow.When PR is between these two values, linear interpolation is used for 
      a smooth transition. 
      TMtf_PR_wgt throttle-model throttle-flow pressure-ratio weight between 
      dMAP/dt and throttle-model manifold filling fueling 
      TMtf_TPScmd_tau_dec This the decreasing TPS command low-pass time constant 
      used to produce the lead-compensated TPS signal described more completely 
      in the comments for the increasing time constant above. 
      TMtf_TPScmd_tau_inc This is the first-order low-pass time constant applied 
      to increasing TPS position commands in order to produce a lead-compensated 
      estimate of the actual TPS. A shorter time constant provides more lead, 
      and longer time constant provides less lead - and can eventually produce 
      lag relative to the actual position.

      The lead-compensated TPS is used as the TPS signal for all throttle flow 
      calculations in this sub-system. This lead compensation can be used to 
      offset any response delays in the fuel metering device (i.e. CFV). 
      TMtf_trans_dzabspct throttle-model transient indication after deadzone 
      application in absolute % 
      TMtf_trans_max See the comments for 'Lower transient for 100% N-rho' 
      above. 
      TMtf_trans_min This air flow estimation technique uses three components 
      for computing the total air flow:

      1) Standard speed-density (N-rho) port (steady-state) flow. 
      2) Throttle-Model (TM) based port (steady-state) flow.
      3) Throttle-Model based throttle transient-only (maniflod filling only) 
      flow.

      Define the 'transient fraction' as the ratio of the transient flow to the 
      port flow:

      x = (3) / (1) 

      If x <= the 'Lower transient for 100% N-rho' then total flow = (1) + (3).
      If x >= the 'Upper transient for 100% TM' then total flow = (2) + (3).
      If x is between these two values, then linear interpolation is used for a 
      smooth transition. 
      TMtf_trans_sldn Whenever the throttle-model based steady-state (i.e. port) 
      flow estimate is used during a transient condition (see comment for 'Lower 
      transient for 100% N-rho'), this parameter determines how quickly N-rho 
      based port-flow is reinstituted once the transient is over. This decay 
      rate is another technique used to insure that any lead-compensation gained 
      from the use of this model during a transient lasts longer than the 
      response lag of the fuel metering device (i.e. CFV). In general, this is 
      on the order of about 2%/ms or about 50ms for a 100% transient.

      TORM_active Logical indicating TORM system is in control of throttle 
      command 
      TORM_drpm_dFPP_max During active throttle override, this is the maximum 
      allowed FPP to RPM transfer function gain allowed. The system will try to 
      reach the max governor rpm unless lower limited by this value. 
      TORM_ena This switch controls the throttle override mode (TORM) system 
      engagement. 
      TORM_FPPdelt_ini This value determines the FPP tolerance required to 
      establish an initial steady-state FPP position prior to arming of TORM. 
      TORM_FPPdelt_mon This is the FPP movement tolerance that will trigger 
      entry into TORM rpm boost once the system has been armed through

      TORM_FPP_cmd_ss FPP steady-state tracking low-pass variable for TORM in 
      FPP fraction 
      TORM_FPP_rampback This ramp rate determines how quickly a throttle

      reference FPP position in order to establish detection of a steady-state 
      FPP condition during the initialization and monitoring phases of the TORM 
      arming sequence. 
      TORM_mode Throttle override mode: Disabled, Enabled, Not Allowed 
      TORM_monvalid_t Prior to TORM arming, the FPP must be stable within the

      torque_driver Estimated driver demand torque as a percentage of the engine 
      reference torque. Calculation is dependent on configuration of "J1939 
      driver demand torque broadcast" and "J1939 torque / engine load 
      conversion" on the Estimators worksheet. 
      torque_Nm_gross Estimated actual/indicated gross torque at current 
      operating conditions. 
      torque_Nm_max Estimated max actual/indicated gross torque at current 
      operating conditions. 
      torque_Nm_ref This is the 'reference torque' used in the J1939 'Engine 
      Configuration' (EC) PG used as a scale basis for the torque curve 
      delivered in this packet. It MUST be greater than or equal to the highest 
      torque entered in the engine torque range calibration below. In general, 
      it should always be at least 20% higher than the highest torque. 
      torque_parasitic Computed Parasitic Losses Torque 
      torque_pct Estimated actual net torque percent (does not include engine 
      reference torque). 
      torque_pct_eng_dmd Estimated engine demand gross torque as a percentage of 
      the engine reference torque - includes friction, derate, and load limits. 
      Calculation is dependent on configuration of "J1939 torque / engine load 
      conversion" on the Estimators worksheet. 
      torque_pct_fric Estimated friction torque percent. If "J1939 engine torque 
      broadcast" is set to 'Torque Percent', then value is a percentage of the 
      engine reference torque. If "J1939 parasitic torque broadcast" is set to 
      'SPN 514 and 2978 (Legacy)', then value includes parasitic torque. 
      torque_pct_gross Estimated actual indicated/gross torque percent. If 
      "J1939 engine torque broadcast" is set to 'Torque Percent', then value is 
      a percentage of the engine reference torque. 
      torque_pct_max Estimated max indicated/gross torque as a percentage of the 
      engine reference torque. 
      torque_pct_max_avail Maximum available engine torque as a percentage of 
      the engine reference torque. Calculation is dependent on configuration of 
      "J1939 max available torque broadcast" and "J1939 torque / engine load 
      conversion" on the Estimators worksheet. 
      torque_select This selection determines the value broadcast in SPN 513 
      "Actual Engine - Percent Torque." The default is engine load, which is 
      determined from the MAP full-load/no-load table used for governing. If the 
      engine torque estimation table below is fully calibrated, select torque 
      percent. The governor load table provides an estimate (though it will have 
      error near the no-load/full-load endpoints) if the table below has not 
      been calibrated. However, the max brake torque at each engine speed will 
      be used to compute the torque in N-m and must be close to the reference 
      torque for reasonable J1939 broadcast results. 
      torque_tbl_fric Estimated friction torque. If "J1939 parasitic torque 
      broadcast" is set to 'SPN 514 and 2978 (Legacy)', then value includes 
      parasitic torque. 
      torq_avail_mode This selection determines the value broadcasted in EEC2 
      SPN 3357 - "Actual Maximum Available Engine - Percent Torque." The default 
      value is 'Engine Load' which is a legacy mode that ignores the reference 
      torque in SPN 544. If the engine torque estimation tables are fully 
      calibrated, select a torque percent option.

      When configured as 'Torque Percent - Maximum', the broadcasted value is 
      the maximum available torque as a percentage of the reference torque and 
      includes active TSC1 torque limits.
      When configured as 'Torque Percent - Maximum, No TSC1', the broadcasted 
      value is the maximum available torque as a percentage of the reference 
      torque and does not include active TSC1 torque limits.

      The next two configurations are currently only applicable to turbocharged 
      engines with "Boost control mode" set to 'delta-P':
      When configured as 'Torque Percent - Immediate', the broadcasted value is 
      the immediately available torque as a percentage of the reference torque 
      and includes active TSC1 torque limits.
      When configured as 'Torque Percent - Immediate, No TSC1', the broadcasted 
      value is the immediately available torque as a percentage of the reference 
      torque and excludes active TSC1 torque limits.

      When configured as one of the 'Torque Percent' options, the broadcasted 
      value is impacted by "J1939 torque / engine load conversion" on the 
      Estimators worksheet. 
      torq_driver_dmd_mode Parameter determines the value broadcasted in EEC1 
      SPN 512 - "Driver's Demand Engine - Percent Torque." The default value is 
      'Torque Percent - Legacy' which is a legacy mode that improperly 
      calculates the engine demand.

      When parameter is set to 'Torque Percent - Corrected, Limited', the 
      calculation is corrected but is limited to the friction torque. The 
      minimum broadcasted value is the friction torque.

      When parameter is set to 'Torque Percent - Corrected, Unlimited', the 
      calculation is corrected and is not limited to the friction torque. A 0% 
      FPP position correlates to 0% driver's demand.

      When parameter is set to 'Torque Percent - FPP Only', then only the user's 
      FPP position is reported. The maximum roadspeed governor and cruise 
      control are removed. Also, the calculation is corrected and is not limited 
      to the friction torque. A 0% FPP position correlates to 0% driver's 
demand.

      The driver's demand torque broadcast is also impacted by "J1939 torque / 
      engine load conversion" on the Estimators worksheet. 
      torq_load_convert Parameter configures the conversion between engine load 
      and net torque percentages for the following calculations:
      - EC1 torque curve points when dynamic points are enabled
      - EEC1 SPN 512 - Driver's Demand Engine Torque
      - EEC1 SPN 2432 - Engine Demand Torque
      - EEC2 SPN 3357 - Actual Maximum Available Engine Torque
      - TSC1 remote torque limit requests

      Engine load values are based on the Governor No-Load/Full-Load table. Net 
      torque percentages are based on the Engine Torque Estimation tables. When 
      parameter is set to 'Disabled (Legacy)', engine load values are not 
      converted to a corresponding net torque percentage. They are assumed to be 
      equivalent.

      When set to 'Enabled', engine load values are converted to a corresponding 
      net torque percentage using both the Governor No-Load/Full-Load table and 
      the Engine Torque Estimation tables. The tables must be calibrated. 
      torq_parasitic_mode Parameter configures the broadcasted engine parasitic 
      losses torque.

      When set to 'SPN 514 and 2978 (Legacy)', the estimated parasitic torque is 
      reported in two locations. It is added to the nominal frictional torque 
      (SPN 514) as well as reported in the estimated engine parasitic losses 
      torque (SPN 2978).

      When set to 'SPN 2978 Only', the estimated parasitic losses torque is only 
      reported in SPN 2978.

      The estimated parasitic losses are comprised of the variable speed fan 
      power consumption and air conditioning compressor torque. Refer to "Fan 
      Power Consumption" table on the Outputs page and "Parasitic Losses Torque" 
      table on the Estimators page for their respective calibrations. 
      TOSB_ena This switch enables the open-stop braking function to eliminate 
      high-velocity impacts in the open position. 
      TOSB_Kd This value is multiplied by the difference between the actual 
      dPS/dt and the limit values defined by the min/max PS PSdt parameters and 
      the current PS (from max to max-delta). For example, if the current dPS/dt 
      = +200 %/s, the actuator is about to impact the open-stop, and the min PS 
      PSdt parameter is +100 %/s, then for a Kd value of 1.0 %/%*sec, the 
      contribution to the braking force will be -100%. 
      TOSB_max_TPSdt dPS/dt value at the min PS (full-open minus open-stop PS 
      delta) position below which no braking action will occur. This must be a 
      value strictly > 0 and should be more positive than the min PS PSdt value. 

      TOSB_min_TPSdt dPS/dt value at the max PS (full-open) position below which 
      no braking action will occur. This must be a value strictly > 0. 
      TOSB_TPSdelta Delta voltage from the current min PS value to initiate 
      open-stop braking. PS values below this delta will not cause any braking 
      action under any condition.

      • Adapt Freeze + Zero Crct
      • Adapt Clear Tables 
      TPSad_adapt_dz If the absolute value of the area error is less than this 
      value, no further adaptive updates are performed on that adaptive area 
      cell(s). 
      TPSad_adapt_lim This is the authority limit enforced for each cell in the 
      area adaptive table. It is a positive number applied symmetrically for + 
      or - limits. 
      TPSad_CdA_adapt_Amin The max adaptive correction for any particular entry 
      in the area adaptive table is given by 

      max(min limit, learn +/- limit * nominal area)

      Examples:
      if adaptive learn +/- limit = 50%
      and adaptive learn min limit = 0.200 in^2

      For a nominal 0.1 in^2 entry, a 0.2 in^2 correction is allowed
      For a nominal 1.0 in^2 entry, a 0.5 in^2 correction is allowed

      The CdA adaptive limits (determined by this parameter and the +/- limit 
      multiplier) are shown in the nominal valve CdA plot. 
      TPSad_CdA_adapt_lim The max adaptive correction for any particular entry 
      in the area adaptive table is given by 

      max(min limit, learn +/- limit * nominal area)

      Examples:
      if adaptive learn +/- limit = 50%
      and adaptive learn min limit = 0.200 in^2

      For a nominal 0.1 in^2 entry, a 0.2 in^2 correction is allowed
      For a nominal 1.0 in^2 entry, a 0.5 in^2 correction is allowed

      The CdA adaptive limits (determined by this parameter and the +/- min area 
      limit) are shown in the nominal valve CdA plot. 
      TPSad_CdA_in2 Throttle Model Adaptive: TM adaptive CdA correction 
      TPSad_CdA_Kadapt This gain drives the speed of the adaptive area 
      correction updates. It is in units of % area change per area error % per 
      second. 
      TPSad_global_use Enabling this option allows the dual-mode throttle-model 
      adaptive corrections to be used in other parts of the system (e.g. for the 
      boost TPS control calculations). 
      TPSad_Kadapt This gain drives the speed of the adaptive area correction 
      updates. It is in units of % adaptive area change per area error % per 
      second. 
      TPSad_learn_wait If adaptive updates are disallowed for any reason (such 
      as those conditions defined by the parameters above), this wait time is 
      imposed after the condition is removed before adaptive updates resume. 
      TPSad_MAP_min When the absolute value of MAP is less than this value, no 
      adaptive updates are performed.

      adaptive active, 1.0=PR adaptive active 
      TPSad_PRadapt_sw Specify the valve pressure ratio where the adaptive 
      updates should start transitioning from an area-based to a pressure 
      ratio-based approach. When the pressure ratio is between the start-end 
      limits, both CdA and PR adaptive are engaged, however, the gains are 
      limited to provide smooth transitions between the 2 adaptive modes. 
      TPSad_PRadapt_swend Specify the valve pressure ratio where the adaptive 
      updates should complete the transition from an area-based to a pressure 
      ratio-based approach. In general, this parameter should be the same as the 
      highlighted cells on the adaptive x-axes. When the pressure ratio is 
      between the start-end limits, both CdA and PR adaptive are engaged, 
      however, the gains are limited to provide smooth transitions between the 2 
      adaptive modes.

      the PR adaptive table is given by max(min limit, learn +/ limit * nominal 
      area)' 
      TPSad_PR_max When MAP/TIP pressure ratios are greater than this value, no 
      adaptive updates are performed. 
      TPSad_status Throttle model adaptive status 
      TPSad_store_EE This switch determines whether the single and dual mode 
      throttle-model adaptive learn tables are retained in battery supported 
      memory or permanent memory. In battery supported memory, the adaptive 
      tables will be cleared if the battery power is removed from the ECM. In 
      permanent memory, a key-on reset sequence must be performed to clear the 
      tables. 
      TPSad_strt_wait Wait time following engine start before any adaptive 
      updates are performed. 
      TPSad_TPS_min Adaptive area updates should be disabled at low valve 
      positions since the 0%, 0 in^2 table entry will not be updated. For 
      example, if the valve flow characterization table has the following 
      entries:

      0.00% 0.000 in^2
      2.56% 0.019 in^2

      then adaptive updates should be shut down when the valve position goes 
      sufficiently below 2.56% in order to keep the adaptive entry term used to 
      adjust the 0.019 in^2 entry from updating when that cell has little of the 
      interpolated focus. 
      TPSad_trans_lim If the ratio of transient flow (i.e. manifold filling only 
      flow) to steady-state flow (i.e. port flow) at the throttle exceeds this 
      value, no adaptive updates are performed. 
      TPScmd_dmdot Throttle flow derivative 
      TPScmd_dmdot_Dz Throttle flow derivative deadzone 
      TPScmd_dmdot_LP Throttle flow derivative low-pass filter time constant 
      TPScmd_dmdot_n Must be in 5ms increments, and < 100 ms. 
      TPSdP_config If absolute TIP and TOP sensors are present and should be 
      differenced to obtain the throttle delta-P, select the 'Absolute (TOP)' 
      option. 
      TPSdP_cyl_events Enter the number of cylinder events to use for TPSdP 
      measurement windowing. Lower values result in faster sensor response, 
      higher values minimize the engine-related pulsations. Set this value to 
      0.0 to disable cylinder event based windowing. Otherwise, this value must 
      be >= 1 if cylinder and the max window is limited to 200ms.

      NOTE: This option requires hardware support and will is not supported on 
      all input channels. 
      TPSdP_ena TPSdP sensor enable switch 
      TPSdP_float throttle cylinder-event windowed delta-P in psi 
      TPSdP_inst_float throttle instantaneous delta-P in psi 
      TPSdP_offset_dPmax This is the maximum TPS delta-P reading for no-flow 
      offset sampling. If the actual TPS delta-P reading is above this limit, 
      the sample is rejected. 
      TPSdP_offset_dPmin This is the minimum TPS delta-P reading for no-flow 
      offset sampling. If the actual TPS delta-P reading is below this limit, 
      the sample is rejected. 
      TPSdP_offset_float TPSdP instantaneous 
      TPSdP_offset_keywt TPSdP sensor offset sampling will be initialized by 
      default at key-on. This is the delay (e.g. for power-up of 5V output) 
      required before sampling should begin. 
      TPSdP_offset_strtwt Set this to a non-zero value to inhibit starting and 
      allow for a pre-start pressure offset pegging. Unlike some of the other 
      pressure pegging routines, the TPSdP offset sampling ONLY occurs during 
      the start inhibit period to ensure valid sampling. 
      TPSdP_offset_tau This is the low-pass filter time constant used to sample 
      the TPS delta-P offset value. 
      TPSdP_Paux_cal TPSdP sensor calibration table select 
      TPSdP_tau This is the low-pass time constant applied to the TPS delta-P 
      low-pass/cubic deadzone filter. It is applied after the offset is added to 
      the raw delta-P sensor reading. 
      TPSdualpot_ena This enables use of a dual pot (redundant pot) position 
      feedback system. 
      TPSerr_maxVbat Obsoleted parameter 
      TPSerr_minVbat Unable to reach lower TPS diagnostic: minimum battery

      TPSerr_pos Unable to reach higher TPS diagnostic: target TPS - actual TPS 
      upper limit 
      TPSerr_run_mode Unable to reach lower TPS diagnostic: Run mode - this 
      parameter should be set to stopped or cranking for systems where an 
      unable-to-reach position error will prevent the engine from reaching an 
      underspeed/running status.

      TPS_ctl_auth Throttle position control authority - max position 
      calibration 
      TPS_EE_store If enabled, the idle/full offsets will be stored in EEPROM 
      and restored on power-on. Note a slight offset is applied to the learn 
      value prior to storing a successful learn in EEPROM to prevent the EEPROM 
      value from being the absolute min/max value ever seen during a learn 
      sequence (see "PS learn EEPROM offset"). 
      TPS_GovN_pct Normalized commanded throttle position as calculated by 
      Gov1/2/3 
      TPS_KcompPin Throttle Kcomp*Pin - filtered 
      TPS_KcompPin_raw Throttle Kcomp*Pin - raw 
      TPS_KOC_sweep_close Sets the command applied to close the throttle during 
      the key-off clear TPS sweep cycles. 
      TPS_KOC_sweep_cnt Selects the number of throttle close/open cycles 
      performed after key-off when the "Key-off clear TPS sweep" parameter is 
      set to 'Enabled'. 
      TPS_KOC_sweep_ena Enables a series of throttle close and open cycles to 
      clear any deposits which formed during the drive cycle. This operation 
      will not execute if "Key-off clear with relay on" is disabled or the ECT 
      has not reached the nominal minimal temperature threshold when key-off 
      occurs. At key-off, sweeping will begin after the time specified by the 
      "Key-off clear wait" parameter has elapsed. 

      Upon completion of the sweep operation, full and idle TPS voltage learning 
      will execute if enabled by the "Key-off learn TPS idle/full" parameter. 
      The "Key-off clear hold" parameter must be configured with sufficient time 
      to allow both the throttle sweep and learning operations to complete.

      TPS_KOC_sweep_hold Sets the amount of time the throttle is held closed or 
      open during the key-off clear TPS sweep cycles. 
      TPS_KOC_sweep_open Sets the command applied to open the throttle during 
      the key-off clear TPS sweep cycles. 
      TPS_learn_cmd_init Initial throttle position commanded to quickly get the 
      throttle close to the full and idle position while not allowing the 
      throttle to hard impact at the stops. The slew rate will be used when 
      moving the final distance from the initial position to the full and idle 
      limited position. 
      TPS_learn_cmd_slew Rate the command percentage increases/decreases to 
      reach full/idle position. If a rate of 0 %/sec is given, this will bypass 
      the slew causing the throttle to open/close as quickly as possible, which 
      may reduce the life of the throttle. 
      TPS_learn_EE_ofst DBW PS learn EEPROM offset 
      TPS_learn_ena Enables the sweeping of the throttle on key-off to learn the 
      full and idle TPS voltages. Learning will not execute if "Key-off clear 
      with relay on" is disabled or if the ECT has not reached the nominal 
      minimal temperature when key-off occurs. On key-off, throttle learning 
      will begin after completion of the key-off clear TPS sweep operation, if 
      enabled. Otherwise, throttle learning will commence after the time 
      specified by "Key-off clear wait" has elapsed.

      When throttle learning is complete, the learned full and idle TPS voltages 
      are committed to EEPROM and restored on power-on. 
      TPS_learn_full_lim DBW PS1 learn full limit 
      TPS_learn_full_ofst DBW PS learn full offset

      TransNeut_ETC2_mode Parameter configures when ETC2 is checked for 
      park/neutral indication. When set to 'Use neutral safety switch config', 
      then park/neutral indication is determined by the "Trans/Park neutral 
      safety switch" parameter. ETC2 will only be checked if "Trans/Park neutral 
      safety switch" is configured as 'J1939 ETC2'. When this parameter is set 
      to 'Sometimes (Legacy)', several subsystems check ETC2 regardless of the 
      "Trans/Park neutral safety switch" configuration. These subsystems check 
      ETC2 to override cruise control, reset the roadspeed loss diagnostic, 
      provide interlock for diagnostic tests, and disengage braking. To always 
      check ETC2 for park/neutral indication, set this parameter to 'Use neutral 
      safety switch config' and set "Trans/Park neutral safety switch" to 'J1939 
      ETC2'. 
      TransNeut_sw If enabled, the transmission neutral safety switch must be 
      validated before a discrete speed governor can be engaged when operating 
      in 'Vehicle' application mode. 
      TransNeut_sw_cfg If an Aux DIG is selected for the switch input, this 
      value determines the active logic state(s). Default values are defined 
      when Aux DIG1 through Aux DIG3 are selected for the switch input:

      Aux DIG1 = Select

      and therefore prevents CL_BM limit fault setting, and the last option 
      halts ramping but also behaves as if the CL_BM has reached its limits in 
      this condition so that a fault can still set. 
      TRIM_lim_bhvP This switch controls how the CL system behaves when the trim

      configuration the fuel pump output will control the gasoline fuel pump, 
      the primary and secondary (if present) lockoff solenoids will control one

      TSC1_SA active TSC1 source address 
      TSC_ff_loadval Current TSC1 feedforward governor load 
      TSC_ff_torque This switch controls the interpretation of the torque field 
      in a speed command (target) mode J1939 TSC1 message. Typically (per J1939) 
      this parameter is ignored and only the speed command field is used in this 
      mode.

      However, by setting this switch to other than 'Disabled', this value will 
      be interpreted as a feedforward term in the Gov3 commanded load % 
      computation.

      If this switch is set to 'Enabled - Gov Load %', the value transmitted is 
      interpreted in units of governor load as defined by the no-load/full-load 
      governor calibration.

      If this switch is set to 'Enabled - Ref Torque %', the value transmitted 
      is interpreted as an absolute torque when multiplied by the J1939 Engine 
      Configuration (EC) reference torque.

      This value is resolved back to governor load % units using the torque 
      estimation calibration. 
      TSC_gov_acc_setpnt Reinitializes the Gov3 integrator value when a J1939 
      TSC1 remote speed request message arrives. This initial integrator value 
      can help smooth the transition to the requested speed.A value of '0' 
      disables this feature. 
      TSC_idlelim_mode This switch controls whether or not a J1939 TSC1 speed 
      command below the current idle schedule will be accepted or limited back 
      to idle speed. If this switch is to '>= Abs Min Speed', then any speed 
      below idle will only be restricted to >= the absolute min governor speed. 
      If this switch is set to '>= Abs Min + Idle Delta', then any speed below 
      idle will only be restricted to >= the absolute min governor speed + the 
      difference between base (fully warm) idle and the current idle schedule 
      speed. 
      TSC_limit_only This switch controls the behavior of full-authority 
      speed-command modes of the TSC1 (torque/speed control) J1939 network 
      messages when a speed-up command greater than the current engine operating 
      condition is received. This switch forces these commands to behave like 
      the speed/torque limit mode of the TSC1 message. 
      TSC_limit_trq Enabled TSC1 torque control mode. The foot pedal must be set 
      to 'Network Throttle' for torque control mode to become active. 
      TSC_maxlim_mode This parameter controls whether or not a J1939 TSC1 speed 
      request above the max governor speed will be accepted or limited back to 
      the max governor speed.

      When set to '<= High Idle Speed', TSC1 speed requests will be allowed in 
      the droop region with full load permitted. Warning: There is a possibility 
      that the engine will be commanded to operate in a region outside of the 
      torque curve. To help mitigate potential engine damage, the Full Load Map 
      should be calibrated to provide suitable protection. In this mode, the Max 
      Governor's control mode must be set to 'Droop'.

      All TSC1 speed requests are restricted by the "Governor speed range 
      absolute max" parameter, regardless of this parameter's value. 
      TSC_RPM_0_ignore This software switch controls how J1939 TSC1 speed 
      setpoint requests with RPM = 0 are handled. By default, TSC1 speed 
      requests with RPM = 0 will be processed and the final speed target may be 
      overridden by the governors.

      If this switch is enabled, TSC1 speed requests with RPM = 0 are ignored. 
      GCP ignored TSC1 speed requests with RPM = 0, so enable this switch for 
      GCP compatibility.

      Tspkret_ECT_hold The hold time determines how long the spark retard 
      modifier is applied at engine start, based on ECT. The 'Engine Start Spark 
      Retard Hold' table is used when the 'Engine start spark retard' parameter 
      is set to "Enabled".

      a value of 10 to effectively set hold time to 5 seconds. 
      Tspkret_FSOt_FSOt Specifies the amount of time fuel shutoff is active in 
      order to determine a spark retard modifier hold time. The 'FSO Spark

      TSSC_ena Parameter enables transmission shift shock control (TSSC) 
      feature. 

      When set to 'Enabled - SPN 64898', engine speed is limited during upshift 
      and switchback events. The pending transmission gear must be provided 
      through ECI PGN 65473, SPN 64898. The received gear is assumed to be a 
      desired/pending gear, not the actual gear.

      When set to 'Enabled - SPN 64762', engine speed is limited during 
      switchback events. The switchback signal must be provided through ECI PGN 
      62720, SPN 64898. The signal is assumed to only inidate shifting request 
      from fwd->rev, or rev->fwd.

      An upshift event is defined as the transmission changing to a higher gear. 
      Both forward upshift and reverse upshift gear changes are supported.

      When an upshift event is detected, an engine speed limit is imposed using 
      "Upshift speed reduction" and "Upshift speed minimum" parameters. See 
      parameters' notes for speed limit calculation. The limit slews in at the 
      "Upshift speed slew down rate" and will last for the "Upshift duration". 
      After the "Upshift duration" has elapsed, the speed limit slews out at the 
      "Upshift speed slew up rate".

      A switchback event is defined as a change in direction while roadspeed is 
      above the "Switchback roadspeed limit". The transmission is either 
      changing from a forward gear to a reverse gear, or a reverse gear to a 
      forward gear.

      When a switchback event is detected, an engine speed limit is imposed 
      using "Switchback speed reduction" and "Switchback speed minimum" 
      parameters. See parameters' notes for speed limit calculation. The limit 
      slews in at the "Switchback speed slew down rate". The limit terminates 
      after the roadspeed has dropped below the "Switchback roadspeed limit" for 
      at least the "Switchback exit delay" time. Alternatively, the limit 
      terminates if another switchback occurs (the driver changes their mind 
      before first switchback completes). The speed limit slews out at the 
      "switchback speed slew up rate". 
      TSSC_gear_d The received pending gear used by Transmission Shift Shock 
      Control (TSSC). 
      TSSC_rpm_limit_ena Upshift and Switchback engine speed limits behave based 
      on selection below.
      - Absolute: computed engine speed limits are utilized.
      - Base Idle Override: computed engine speed limits will be utilized with 
      respect to base idle engine speed effectively being a lower limit. 
      TSSC_rpm_max Maximum engine speed limit being applied to Gov3 by 
      Transmission Shift Shock Control (TSSC). 
      TSSC_rpm_min Minimum engine speed limit being applied to Gov3 by 
      Transmission Shift Shock Control (TSSC). 
      TSSC_sw_delta_rpm Parameter is used to calculate the engine speed limit 
      during a switchback event. When a switchback event is received, the speed 
      limit is calculated as the current engine speed minus the switchback speed 
      reduction. If the calculated speed limit is less than the "Switchback 
      speed minimum", then the "Switchback speed minimum" is used as the speed 
      limit during the switchback. See "Transmission shift shock control mode" 
      for switchback event definition and details. 
      TSSC_sw_down_rpmdt Engine speed limit's slew-down rate during a switchback 
      event. 
      TSSC_sw_LoadLim_pct Engine load limit that will be imposed at the 
      beginning switchback event. 
      TSSC_sw_min_rpm Minimum engine speed limit that can be imposed during a 
      switchback event. 
      TSSC_sw_RS_delay The amount of additional time to limit engine speed while 
      exiting a switchback event. A switchback event is exited when the 
      roadspeed drops below the "Switchback roadspeed limit" for this 
      parameter's amount of time. See "Transmission shift shock control mode" 
      for more details. 
      TSSC_sw_RS_lmt Roadspeed limit for detecting a switchback event. A 
      switchback event is defined as a change in direction while roadspeed is 
      above this parameter's value. The transmission is either changing from a 
      forward gear to a reverse gear, or a reverse gear to a forward gear at an 
      elevated roadspeed. To disable switchback detection, set parameter to 0. 
      TSSC_sw_up_LoadLimdt Engine load limit slew-up rate after a switchback 
      event concludes. 
      TSSC_sw_up_rpmdt Engine speed limit's slew-up rate after a switchback 
      event concludes. 
      TSSC_up_delta_rpm Parameter is used to calculate the engine speed limit 
      during an upshift. When a pending upshift event is received, the speed 
      limit is calculated as the current engine speed minus the upshift speed 
      reduction. If the calculated speed limit is less than the "Upshift speed 
      minimum", then the "Upshift speed minimum" is used as the speed limit 
      during the upshift. See "Transmission shift shock control mode" for 
      upshift event definition and details. 
      TSSC_up_down_rpmdt Engine speed limit's slew-down rate during an upshift 
      event. 
      TSSC_up_dur The amount of time that engine speed is limited during an 
      upshift. Speed limiting begins with the reception of a pending upshift 
      event and ends when this parameter's amount of time has passed. The 
      duration only includes speed being slewed down and held. Slewing up is not 
      included and occurs after this duration has elapsed. See "Transmission 
      shift shock control mode" for upshift event definition and details. 
      TSSC_up_min_rpm Minimum engine speed limit that can be imposed during an 
      upshift event. 
      TSSC_up_RS_Iacc_rst During an upshift, the roadspeed governor's integrator 
      is set to this parameter's value to prevent windup during the shift and 
      overshoot after the shift. This parameter is only applicable when 
      "Roadspeed function" is configured to limit the max throttle and 
      "Roadspeed RPM-based all-speed limit" is enabled on the Roadspeed 
      worksheet. 
      TSSC_up_up_rpmdt Engine speed limit's slew-up rate after an upshift event 
      concludes.

      updates. This may be caused by a sensor fault, or may be explained by 
      display variables Phi_post_act, CLInactiveFlag, or ICAV_cat_prot_act.
      - "Aborted: non-stoich phi command": the phi command was out of bounds of 
      normal stoich control. This may be explained by display variable 
      CL_precat_phi_nonstoich.
      - "Aborted: closed-loop disabled": conditions disabled closed-loop 
      control, or the RMS signal was too low. This may be explained by display 
      variables fuel_ctl_mode, CM1_RMSsrc, CM2_RMSsrc, CM1_RMScomp, CM2_RMScomp, 
      CB1pst_phiFB_RMS, or CB2pst_phiFB_RMS.
      - "Aborted: invalid conditions": calibration settings or other conditions 
      prevent monitor from updating for the minimum number of times to unlatch. 
      This likely means that the test diagnostic time is not long enough to 
      permit the number of closed-loop update cycles specified as the unlatch 
      count of the appropriate "cat monitor" fault, on the Diagnostics sheet. 
      The duration of a closed-loop update cycle is indicated as display 
      variable CLp_tau.

      TSTCM_tmr Time in current catalyst test state. 
      TSTCM_upd_cnt Number of closed-loop updates received during the "test 
      diagnostic time". 
      TSTCM_upd_req The number of closed-loop updates required within the "test 
      diagnostic time".

      TWCctrl_CBT_FSO_ena Force lean FSO & min CBT before entering ROL control 
      mode 
      TWCctrl_CBT_min Minimum CBT threshold for entering ROL control mode if 
      required 
      TWCctrl_FSO_last Parameter is the minimum time since ROL was reset during 
      a fuel shutoff event. Parameter allows the post-catalyst control mode to 
      transition from ROL (mode 0) or temp ROL (mode 2) to post-cat phi (mode 1) 
      whenever transient. To be considered reset, the ROL must have reached a 
      value of "TWC FSO min ROL reset threshold" during the fuel shutoff event. 
      Only applicable when "TWC transient error reaction" is set to 'Allow 
      Post-Cat Phi Control'. 
      TWCctrl_FSO_ROL_min Parameter is the minimum ROL during a previous fuel 
      shutoff event that allows the post-catalyst control mode to transition 
      from ROL (mode 0) or temp ROL (mode 2) to post-cat phi (mode 1) whenever 
      transient. Only applicable when "TWC transient error reaction" is set to 
      'Allow Post-Cat Phi Control'. 
      TWCctrl_ROL_d Desired TWC ROL for post-cat control 
      TWCctrl_ROL_d_def TWC desired relative oxygen level

      TWCctrl_ROL_e TWC relative oxygen level error 
      TWCctrl_ROL_init_hi Table-based ROL high re-initialization value for TWC 
      control. 
      TWCctrl_ROL_init_lo Table-based ROL low re-initialization value for TWC 
      control. 
      TWCctrl_ROL_init_sel Parameter determines the value to re-initialize the 
      ROL state when transitioning to post-cat phi control. Value is either a 
      single point which is fuel based or an OSC table-based value. 
      TWCctrl_trans_react Parameter determines which post-catalyst control mode 
      to use when catalyst control is considered transient (CL1_post_SS_status 
      is 'Transient'). When parameter is set to 'Force Temporary ROL Control', 
      then the post-catalyst control mode is always forced to temporary ROL 
      control whenever transient (legacy behavior). When parameter is set to 
      'Allow Post-Cat Phi Control', then the post-catalyst state can transition 
      from ROL (mode 0) or temp ROL (mode 2) to post-cat phi (mode 1) when 
      transient. However, the following conditions must all be satisfied:
      - The time since ROL was reset during a fuel shutoff event is greater than 
      "TWC ROL time since FSO". To be considered reset, the ROL must have 
      reached a value of "TWC FSO min ROL reset threshold" during the fuel 
      shutoff event.
      - The post-cat phi must be outside of the window that is used for 
      transitioning to post-cat phi control (mode 1: less than CL1_postcat_lo_th 
      or greater than CL1_postcat_hi_th).
      If the above conditions are not satisfied, then post-cat control mode is 
      transitioned to temporary ROL control when transient.

      diagnostic threshold. When the accumulated oxygen storage capacity of a 
      catalyst reaches the TWC oxygen storage monitor diagnostic threshold plus 
      the TWC fault diagnostic margin, the catalyst monitor will complete even 
      if the phi threshold has not been passed. This is to limit the catalyst 
      monitor from over fueling the catalyst if it is reasonably sure the 
      catalyst is not OTL. Set to 0 to disable this feature. If this feature is 
      enabled "TWC oxygen storage error Kp" must be set to 0.0%. 
      TWCdiag_OSC_max Maximum value of estimated OSC from TWC monitor to be 
      considered valid

      TWCdiag_OSC_period Elapsed engine hours since last TWC OSC completion 
      after which to ignore OSC diagnostic margin and complete monitor to rich 
      tailpipe conditions. 
      TWCdiag_phi_d TWC diagnostic pre-cat phi target 
      TWCdiag_phi_d_app TWC diagnostic pre-cat phi target to use after ROL drops 
      below the post-FSO enrichment threshold and before post-cat phi reaches 
      the diagnostic completion threshold. When set to 0, uses the normal phi 
      target when ROL is below the threshold. 
      TWCdiag_phi_pst_lean TWC diagnostic lean post-cat threshold for saturated 
      catalyst 
      TWCdiag_phi_pst_thld TWC diagnostic post-cat phi threshold 
      TWCdiag_pst_rich_rst Specifies whether the "TWC fault post-cat phi 
      threshold" must be met once per key cycle before the first OSC monitor 
      executes, or must be met prior to each OSC monitor. 
      TWCdiag_state TWC diagnostic status

      the oxygen storage capacity. The OSC is then adjusted by this value after 
      a successful TWC diagnostic.

      warmup to closed-loop transition temperature" is reached. 
      UEGOB_Thysteresis Determines the temperature at which the UEGO is assumed

      engine start (table is above the heater on-time table). When the UEGO 
      reaches this temperature, it begins closed-loop operation with a 
      temperature target specified in the "UEGO closed-loop temperature target" 
      value below. Open-loop fueling is still used, however, until the "UEGO 
      warmup to closed-loop transition temperature" is reached. 
      UEGON_Twarmup The UEGO heater follows the heater on-time warmup schedule 
      (table above) after an initial heater start delay specified by the ECT at 
      engine start (table is above the heater on-time table). When the UEGO 
      reaches this temperature, it begins closed-loop operation with a 
      temperature target specified in the "UEGO closed-loop temperature target"

      transport delay extended models.

      UEGO_driftE_crct_max This limit is applied after the assumed fuel leakage 
      is taken into account. 
      UEGO_driftE_crct_min This limit is applied after the assumed fuel leakage 
      is taken into account. 
      UEGO_driftE_gain Enter the 0-100% gain / sec to use for new drift 
      compensation samples. 
      UEGO_driftE_gain_max The number of minutes since the last UEGO drift 
      sample is multiplied by the time-based gain to determine the final % gain. 
      After being limited by this max gain value, the resulting % pump current 
      error is given by:

      error(t) = (1-x) * error(t-1) + x * new_sample
      where x = this value * minutes since last sample 
      UEGO_driftE_gain_min The number of hours since the last UEGO drift sample 
      is multiplied by the time-based gain to determine the final % gain. After 
      being limited by this min gain value, the resulting % pump current error 
      is given by:

      error(t) = (1-x) * error(t-1) + x * new_sample
      where x = this value * hours since last sample 
      UEGO_driftE_inject_t This parameter determines how often a drift sample 
      will occur when the UEGO sensor is used for EGR flow measurement. Note 
      that samples can only occur when the intake manifold pressure is 
      sufficiently less than barometric pressure. This time period is active 
      even during boosted situations, i.e. if the engine operates at higher 
      boost for an extended period of time, a sample will be taken when the 
      engine returns to a low-boost situation.

      NOTE: This parameter should be set to 0 for intake-mounted EGR UEGO 
      sensors in order to force a sample any time FSO is active. 
      UEGO_driftE_Ip_tol After the sampling interval is complete, each point 
      acquired during this interval is compared to the mean value and must be 
      within this % of the mean value. If any of the samples violate this 
      condition, the sample is rejected and the sampling interval starts over. 
      UEGO_driftE_samp_ms The UEGO pump current is averaged over this sampling 
      interval. 
      UEGO_driftE_stable_t This pre-sampling period wait is enforced following a 
      toggle of the EGR UEGO flow control valve, just prior to drift sampling. 
      UEGO_driftE_Terr_max During the sampling interval, the UEGO temperature 
      must be equal to the closed-loop temperature target +/- the limit 
      specified by this parameter. 
      UEGO_drift_crct_max This limit is applied after the assumed fuel leakage 
      is taken into account. 
      UEGO_drift_crct_min This limit is applied after the assumed fuel leakage 
      is taken into account. 
      UEGO_drift_ECT_min Minimum ECT for enabling fuel shutoff throttle open 
      UEGO drift compensation. 
      UEGO_drift_FT_min Minimum FT for enabling fuel shutoff throttle open UEGO 
      drift compensation. 
      UEGO_drift_gain_hr Enter the 0-100% gain / hour to use for new drift 
      compensation samples. The number of hours since the last UEGO drift sample 
      is multiplied by this value to determine the final % gain. After being 
      limited by the max gain value below, the resulting % pump current error is 
      given byerror(t) = (1-x) * error(t-1) + x * new_samplewhere x = this value 
      * hours since last sample 
      UEGO_drift_gain_max The number of hours since the last UEGO drift sample 
      is multiplied by the time-based gain to determine the final % gain. After 
      being limited by this max gain value, the resulting % pump current error 
      is given by

      error(t) = (1-x) * error(t-1) + x * new_sample

      where x = this value * hours since last sample 
      UEGO_drift_gain_min The number of hours since the last UEGO drift sample 
      is multiplied by the time-based gain to determine the final % gain. After 
      being limited by this min gain value, the resulting % pump current error 
      is given by:

      error(t) = (1-x) * error(t-1) + x * new_sample
      where x = this value * hours since last sample 
      UEGO_drift_holdoff While drift compensation is active (i.e. during the 
      pre-sampling waits and sampling intervals), certain other features in the 
      ECM (e.g. exhaust braking) are prevented from activating. To provide 
      repeatable FSO TPS open engagement of these features, this time is used to 
      delay their engagement from the start of FSO TPS open. The entire drift 
      sampling sequence must be completed during this time interval, or drift 
      sampling for the FSO TPS event will be abandoned. If none of these 
      features are waiting for drift compensation to complete, the drift 
      compensation sampling event is allowed to extend past the time interval 
      specified here. 
      UEGO_drift_inject_t If fuel shutoff is set to 'UEGO drift only' mode, an 
      FSO event is scheduled in order to perform UEGO drift compensation. This 
      parameter determines how often the FSO event will occur. If the UEGO 
      recovery configuration is set to 'Drift Triggered', this time must be 
      smaller than the recovery interval specified in the recovery configuration 
      feature.This parameter is ignored if FSO is disabled or always enabled. 
      UEGO_drift_Ip_tol After the sampling interval is complete, each point 
      acquired during this interval is compared to the mean value and must be 
      within this % of the mean value. If any of the samples violate this 
      condition, the sample is rejected and the sampling interval starts over. 
      UEGO_drift_leakage The assumed fuel leakage during FSO TPS open events. 
      This will be compared to the actual air flow during the event, and the 
      pump current correction reading will be adjusted to take into account this 
      fuel leakage. This parameter is only used for gaseous fueled systems. 
      UEGO_drift_learn This feature accounts for sensor aging by sampling the 
      UEGO feedback during known operating conditions. For pre- and post-cat 
      UEGO sensors:This period is during the throttle-open portion of fuel 
      shutoff (when only air surrounds the UEGO sensor). Fuel shutoff must be 
      enabled for this feature to be active for pre- and post-cat UEGO sensors 
      and is only available on ECMs using internal UEGO hardware.For EGR UEGO 
      sensors:Drift compensation is enabled regardless of this setting, and 
      happens periodically whenever the intake manifold pressure is low enough 
      to drive fresh air across the UEGO sensor. Internal and/or external UEGO 
      sensors can be used for drift compensation in EGR UEGO mode. 
      UEGO_drift_min_flow This limit prevents the drift compensation from 
      activating when the air flow is too low for an accurate sample (e.g. in 
      case of a slight fuel leak during FSO). On small displacement engines, 
      this parameter may prevent drift compensation from activating, which is 
      the desired behavior in order to avoid erroneous samples. On systems where 
      fuel leakage is zero, this parameter should be set to a moderately small 
      value in order to allow drift compensation at modest air flows. 
      UEGO_drift_sample_ms The UEGO pump current is averaged over this sampling 
      interval. If any of the checks below are violated in this interval, the 
      results are discarded and the sampling interval restarts. 
      UEGO_drift_stable_wt Fixed wait period following the fuel shutoff throttle 
      opening. This ensures a minimum time before UEGO air-sampling begins, and 
      allows the transport delay to stabilize before the transport-delay wait 
      period begins. 
      UEGO_drift_Tdelays Following the fixed FSO TPS open wait interval, a 
      transport-delay based wait period is used to ensure all the fuel has 
      cleared the system. The maximum transport delay is latched during this 
      period and this parameter specifies the number of (maximum) transport 
      delay periods to wait before starting the sample process. 
      UEGO_drift_Terr_max During the sampling interval, the UEGO temperature 
      must be equal to the closed-loop temperature target +/- the limit 
      specified by this parameter. 
      uego_dt_cmd Enabled/Disabled state for the UEGO drift test

      UEGO_EBP_C This parameter is only used in the 'Delta-P Mode (Legacy)' for 
      UEGO EBP correction. See the comments for 'UEGO EBP correction mode' above 
      for further details. In this mode: 
      UEGO_EBP_EBPo This parameter is only used in the 'Pressure Ratio Mode' for 
      UEGO EBP correction.
      See the comments for 'UEGO EBP correction mode' above for futher details.
      In this mode:

      Phi = 1 - (1-Phi_raw) * (EBP + K)/EBP * EBPo/(EBPo + K)where

      K = UEGO_EBP_Klean or UEGO_EBP_Krich depending on Phi

      EBPo = UEGO_EBP_EBPo (this parameter) 
      UEGO_EBP_ena This switch selects the UEGO exhaust back pressure (EBP) 
      corrections mode.
      The modes of operation are:

      1)Disabled: No EBP correction is performed
      Phi = Phi_raw

      2) Delta-P Mode (Legacy): Only mode available until 2110. This mode only 
      uses the 'delta-P mode constant' parameter UEGO_EBP_C:

      Phi = Phi_raw + (1-Phi_raw) * (EBP - BPs) * UEGO_EBP_C

      3) Pressure Ratio Mode: Newer higher accuracy correction mode available in 
      2110.
      This mode only uses the 3 'P-ratio mode...' parameters:

      Phi = 1 - (1-Phi_raw) * (EBP + K)/EBP * EBPo/(EBPo + K)where

      K = UEGO_EBP_Klean or UEGO_EBP_Krich depending on Phi

      EBPo = the 'EBP std' parameter UEGO_EBP_EBPo

      4) Manufacturer EOL Provided Mode: The CAN-based NTK ZFAS-U2 Intake UEGO 
      reports a 'factor of pressure' (Kfop) constant to the ECM. This Kfop 
      constant is sensor specific, and part of the NTK EOL calibration for the 
      sensor. The ECM uses the Kfop constant to provide pressure corrected pump 
      current and O2 concentration for calculating Phi. 

      NOTE: The 'Manuf. EOL Provided Mode' should only be used with NTK ZFAS-U2 
      Intake sensor. If it is used with any other sensor type (Bosch, NTK 6312 
      or NTK ZFAS-U2 Exhaust), then this mode will NOT provide any EBP 
      correction, and it will be the equivalent to the 'Disabled Mode'. 
      UEGO_EBP_Klean Phi = 1 - (1-Phi_raw) * (EBP + K)/EBP * EBPo/(EBPo + K) 
      UEGO_EBP_Krich This parameter is only used in the 'Pressure Ratio Mode' 
      for UEGO EBP correction.
      See the comments for 'UEGO EBP correction mode' above for futher details.
      In this mode:

      Phi = 1 - (1-Phi_raw) * (EBP + K)/EBP * EBPo/(EBPo + K)where

      K = UEGO_EBP_Krich (this parameter) is only used when Phi_raw > 1.

      EBPo = the 'EBP std' parameter UEGO_EBP_EBPo 
      UEGO_extreme_rich UEGO primary operation range: This option is used to 
      specify primarily stoich+lean or stoich+rich operation. It is intended for 
      marine applications that run very rich, and require a lower-gain setting 
      on Bosch UEGO only hardware platforms to avoid sensor saturation near 
      Phi=1.2-1.3.

      UEGO_recvr_duration Time at the elevated UEGO target temperature. 
      UEGO_recvr_FPPFSO_wt If recovery is active and this value is non-zero, the 
      UEGO temperature target is set to the normal closed-loop temperature 
      target before FPP-based FSO engages. This time specifies the wait time 
      between the reduction of the UEGO temperature target and FPP-based FSO 
      engagement. Set this value to 0 to disable this feature. If disabled, 
      recovery will continue throughout the FSO event. 
      UEGO_recvr_GovFSO_wt If recovery is active and this value is non-zero, the 
      UEGO temperature target is set to the normal closed-loop temperature 
      target before Gov3-based FSO engages. This time specifies the wait time 
      between the reduction of the UEGO temperature target and Gov3-based FSO 
      engagement. Set this value to 0 to disable this feature. If disabled, 
      recovery will continue throughout the FSO event. 
      UEGO_recvr_interval Time between recovery events. If the UEGO recovery 
      configuration is set to "Drift Triggered" and FSO is set to only execute 
      to acquire a drift compensation reading, this time must be larger than the 
      FSO injection interval specified in the drift compensation feature. 
      UEGO_recvr_MAPFSO_wt If recovery is active and this value is non-zero, the 
      UEGO temperature target is set to the normal closed-loop temperature 
      target before MAP-based FSO engages. This time specifies the wait time 
      between the reduction of the UEGO temperature target and MAP-based FSO 
      engagement. Set this value to 0 to disable this feature. If disabled, 
      recovery will continue throughout the FSO event. 
      UEGO_recvr_mode If enabled, this will periodically elevate the UEGO 
      closed-loop temperature target in order to burn off any contaminants from 
      the UEGO sensor. It can be used as a stand alone feature ('Time 
      Triggered') or in conjunction with the UEGO drift compensation for a more 
      robust recovery solution ('Time + Drift Triggered'). 

      When one of the 'Time + Drift Triggered' choices is selected, the recovery 
      will be skipped if the drift compensation offsets are within the min/max 
      pump current correction limits and the most recent drift compensation 
      sample was taken within the recovery interval window. If the last drift 
      compensation sample was too long ago (e.g. recovery interval set to 1 
      hours and most recent drift correction was 1.1 hours ago), the recovery 
      will execute regardless of the drift compensation %. 

      The elevated burn off temperature ('recovery temperature target') can 
      either be a fixed target or it can be selected from the UEGO Recovery 
      Temperature Table based on the most recent drift compensation %.

      Note that if this is set to 'Time + Drift Triggered' and FSO is set to 
      only execute to acquire a drift compensation reading, the interval time 
      below must be larger than the FSO injection interval specified in the 
      drift compensation feature. 
      UEGO_recvr_T This temperature should be greater than the closed-loop 
      target temperature, but low enough to avoid UEGO damage. 
      UEGO_recvr_Tramp Ramp rate to use during the temperature ramp up and ramp 
      down periods of the recovery. Set this to a non-zero reasonable value. The 
      ramp time is not included as part of the recovery duration.

      estimate of the pullup resistance inside the gauge itself. This value does 
      not have be accurate - it only affects the initial gauge movement after 
      key-on. 
      V1gd_Rpu_tau This time-constant determines the effective closed-loop 
      resistance control update rate for the 'Resistance Simulation' mode of 
      operation. It does not apply otherwise. It should generally be set to 
      approximately 100ms, but may be increase or decreased to achieve the 
      desired gauge response time and stability. 
      V1gd_Vexc_ratio This is the internal resistor divider ratio of the gauge

      VP_eng_config current engine configuration - network FPP, 
      dual-bank/V-config, CL, DBW 
      VP_shift_rpmd This is the target shift speed parameter to be stored and 
      communicated by the engine ECM to other devices on the vessel which 
      interact with shift functions. It is not currently actively used in the 
      engine ECM software other than for communication purposes. 
      VP_shift_rpmmax At engine speeds above this setpoint, the shift actuator 
      target position will not be updated, but the throttle will be closed and 
      shift interrupt will be allowed to engage (but it will only engage if the 
      calibration allows it). Once the engine speed drops below this setpoint, 
      the ECM will attempt to shift. Note that this speed defaults to the VP 
      ECM-communicated maximum shift speed for backwards compatibility.

      NOTE: The maximum engine speed and mechanical engagement delay values are 
      used anytime an ECI hand controller is present, even if shift actuator 
      control is disabled. This is for compatibility with systems that use the 
      ECI hand controller to control the shift solenoids. In this scenario, the 
      hand control packet gives the ECM a desired gear. The ECM will zero the 
      foot pedal command, and when the engine speed is below the max engine 
      shift speed, a countdown timer will begin to allow for the mechanical 
      engagement of the drive. The shift is assumed complete when the mechanical 
      delay timer expires, and actual gear = desired gear at this time (actual 
      gear is translated back to the ECI hand controller via an ETC2 message). 
      VP_shift_rpmmax_neut This is the maximum shift speed parameter to be 
      stored and communicated by the engine ECM to other VP devices on the 
      vessel which interact with shift functions.

      If this value is > 0, this value will be broadcast on CAN only when the 
      engine is not in PARK or NEUTRAL. This value is intended to provide an 
      alternate RPM limit to the VP controller for shifts to NEUTRAL.

      NOTE: This value is not currently actively used in the engine ECM software 
      other than for communication purposes to VP devices. 
      VP_troll_rpmmax This is the maximum troll speed parameter to be stored and 
      communicated by the engine ECM to other devices on the vessel which 
      interact with shift functions. It is not currently actively used in the 
      engine ECM software other than for communication purposes.

      Controller 1 (ERC1) PGN is received from the transmission retarder 
      controller with any of the following conditions:
      - SPN 520, "Actual Retarder - Percent Torque" is negative, or
      - SPN 1715, "Drivers Demand Retarder - Percent Torque" is negative; or

      VSFan_rpm Fan speed (rpm) 
      VSFan_rpmd Current desired fan speed.

      VSFan_rpmd_tau Specifies the time constant used for the desired fan speed

      VSFan_rpm_dot Current fan speed closed loop control derivative value. 
      VSFan_rpm_dot_tau Specifies the time constant used for the fan speed 
      derivative low-pass filter. 
      VSFan_rpm_dot_window This time window determines the number of derivative 
      samples stored for fan speed closed loop control. Multiply the desired 
      number of samples by 50ms to generate this value. 
      VSFan_rpm_err Fan speed error 
      VSFan_rpm_Iacc Current fan speed closed loop control integrator value. 
      VSFan_SHP_actv Indicates if fan slip heat protection is active. 
      VSFan_SHP_ena Parameter enables fan slip heat protection for both 
      open-loop and closed-loop fan control.

      When parameter is set to 'Disabled', the final desired fan speed 
      (VSFan_rpmd_final) is equal to the desired fan speed (VSFan_rpmd).

      When parameter is set to 'Enabled' and closed-loop control is active ("Fan 
      speed closed-loop control" is 'Enabled'), the final desired fan speed 
      (VSFan_rpmd_final) is modified to protect the fan from generating too much 
      heat from slip. If the desired fan speed (VSFan_rpmd) is between the lower 
      and upper limits in the "Fan Slip Heat Protection" table, then 
      VSFan_rpmd_final is set to either the lower or upper limit in the table. 
      If VSFan_rpmd is between the upper hysteresis and upper limit points, then 
      VSFan_rpmd_final is set to the upper limit. If VSFan_rpmd is between the 
      lower hysteresis and lower limit points, then VSFan_rpmd_final is set to 
      the lower limit. When VSFan_rpmd is not between the lower and upper 
      limits, then VSFan_rpmd_final is set to VSFan_rpmd.

      When open-loop control is active ("Fan speed closed-loop control" is 
      'Disabled'), fan slip heat protection is applied similarly. The desired 
      fan speed (VSFan_rpmd) is calculated as the desired fan maximum percentage 
      (VSFan_pctd) multiplied by the theoretical max fan speed at the current 
      engine speed. The final desired fan speed (VSFan_rpmd_final) is calculated 
      using the same method as described for closed-loop control.

      Feature is temporarily disabled when the variable speed fan diagnostics is 
      active. 
      VSFan_slip_x The actual maximum fan speed at a certain engine RPM may be 
      slightly less than the ideal fan speed due to belt slippage. A constant 
      value of 1.00 for the correction factor indicates there is no belt slip, 
      while values < 1.00 indicate there is some belt slippage 
      VSFan_status Variable speed fan status:

      CAN-based wastegate control valve, SPN 64768 in ECI PGN 42286. This option 
      also requires that "Boost WGA output channel" is set to 'CAN-based WGCV' 
      on the Boost worksheet. The following ECI PGNs are required: 65409, and 
      42285-42286. The following SPNs are required: 64766-64770.

      WTRIN_DC Water intrusion drive duty-cycle 
      WTRIN_ena This is the water intrusion detection system enable switch. The 
      system may be always enabled, or only enabled if the Oil Quality 
      monitoring system is enabled and an Oil Quality sensor is successfully 
      detected. This special mode was created to allow plug-and-play of the two 
      systems whenever they always appear in tandem on an engine. 
      WTRIN_flt_cnt Water intrusion fault latch 
      WTRIN_out Specify the output channel for driving the water intrusion 
      sensor. The input is assumed to be on Aux DIG3. 
      WTRIN_rpm_lmt Water intrusion detection will be disabled when the engine

      and Vpp > this value. This value is used with the lower Vpp level and the 
      corresponding lower Vavg level for linear interpolation when Vavg is 
      between the lower level and 2.5V. 
      WTRIN_Vpp_L Water intrusion diagnostic fault trigger level if Vavg <= 
      lower level and Vpp > this value. This value is used with the upper Vpp 
      level for linear interpolation when Vavg is between the lower level and 
      2.5V.

      to the lower Vpp trigger level. If Vavg<=this value then the lower Vpp 
      trigger is used, if Vavg >=2.5 volts then the upper Vpp trigger is used, 
      linear interpolation is used between these two values.

      XEGOH_short_update Parameter determines when the EGO and UEGO heater short 
      to power faults are updated.

      When set to 'Conditional (Legacy)', the short to power faults are not 
      updated if their corresponding short to ground fault's duty cycle entry 
      condition is satisfied. For example, the "EGOH2 short to power" fault will 
      not update if the "EGOH2 open / ground short" fault's duty cycle entry 
      condition is satisfied. This legacy mode may be undesirable if the short 
      to ground and short to power duty cycle entry conditions are overlapping 
      (short to ground duty cycle threshold is larger than the short to power 
      duty cycle threshold). When thresholds overlap and duty cycle is actively 
      between thresholds, the short to power fault will not update even if all 
      of its entry conditions are satisfied.

      When set to 'Unconditional', the heater short to power faults are updated 
      unconditionally. The short to power and short to ground faults are updated 
      independently.

      The following EGO and UEGO heater faults are affected by this parameter:
      "EGOH1 short to power" fault
      "EGOH2 short to power" fault
      "EGOH3 short to power" fault
      "EGOH4 short to power" fault
      "UEGOH1 short to power" fault
      "UEGOH2 short to power" fault

      pre-catalyst oxygen sensor out of range diagnostic. 
      XEGOi_OOR_phi_max Specifies the upper equivalence ratio threshold for the 
      pre-catalyst oxygen sensor out of range diagnostic. 
      XEGOi_OOR_phi_min Specifies the lower equivalence ratio threshold for the 
      pre-catalyst oxygen sensor out of range diagnostic.
